I really don't. I don't understand how I could hate you so much after so much time. How, no matter how much I'd like to not hate you, I hate you even more. It grows. I can't even see you now. All I see is a picture of you. You and her. I don't even know if the picture's real anymore. I don't even care. It's a made-up picture. It invades my head. The two of you. And this picture stings even more than if I'd actually seen you with her. It cuts me. It cuts me so deep I'll never get over it. And I can't get rid of this picture either. It just comes. Uninvited. Kinda' like a little torture. And I blame you more for this little torture than I do for what you did.</span></p></div></blockquote><p class="context">standing slowly</p><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>I'll go.</span></p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>You better.</span></p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>Why?</span></p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>You just better.</span></p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>I thought you wanted me to stay.</span></p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>I got somebody coming to get me.</span></p></div></blockquote><p class="context">short pause, on his feet</p><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>Here?</span></p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>Yeah, here.

Eddie!</span></p></div></blockquote><p class="context">Short pause. She looks after Eddie, then turns fast, moves upstage to window. She parts the Venetian blinds, looks out window, turns back into room. She rushes to upstage side of bed, gets down on hands and knees, pulls a suitcase out from under bed, throws on top of bed, opens it. She rushes into bathroom, disappears, leaving door open. She comes back on with various items of clothing, throws stuff in suitcase, turns as if to go back into bathroom. Stops. She hears Eddie off left. She quickly shuts suitcase, slides it under bed again, rushes around to downstage side of bed. Sits on bed. Stands again. Rushes back into bathroom, returns with hairbrush, slams bathroom door. Starts brushing her hair as though that's what she's been doing all along. She sits on bed brushing her hair. Eddie enters stage left, slams door behind him, door booms. He stands there holding a ten gauge shotgun in one hand and a bottle of tequila in the other. He moves toward bed, tosses shotgun on bed beside her.</p><p class="context">She stands, moves upstage, stops brushing her hair</p><blockquote class="message  left"><div class="message-body  left"><p class="message-text"><span>Oh, wonderful.
