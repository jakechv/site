      <p class=context>very cold, quick, almost monotone voice like she&#39;s writing 
       him a letter
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>I don&#39;t understand my feelings. I really 
         don&#39;t. I don&#39;t understand how I could hate you so much after so much 
         time. How, no matter how much I&#39;d like to not hate you, I hate you even 
         more. It grows. I can&#39;t even see you now. All I see is a picture of you. You 
         and her. I don&#39;t even know if the picture&#39;s real anymore. I don&#39;t 
         even care. It&#39;s a made-up picture. It invades my head. The two of you. And 
         this picture stings even more than if I&#39;d actually seen you with her. It 
         cuts me. It cuts me so deep I&#39;ll never get over it. And I can&#39;t get rid 
         of this picture either. It just comes. Uninvited. Kinda&#39; like a little 
         torture. And I blame you more for this little torture than I do for what you 
         did.</span>

      <p class=context>standing slowly
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>I&#39;ll go.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>You better.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Why?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>You just better.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>I thought you wanted me to stay.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>I got somebody coming to get me.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>short pause, on his feet
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Here?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Yeah, here. Where else?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>makes a move toward her upstage
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>You been seeing somebody?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>She moves quickly down left, crosses right.
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>When was the last time we were together, Eddie? Huh? 
         Can you remember that far bac</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Who&#39;ve you been seeing?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>He moves violently toward her.
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Don&#39;t you touch me! Don&#39;t you even think about 
         it.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>How long have you been seeing him!</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>What difference does it make!</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Short pause. He stares at her, then turns suddenly and exits out 
       the stage left door and slams it behind him. Door slams.
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Eddie, where are you going? Eddie!</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Short pause. She looks after Eddie, then turns fast, moves 
       upstage to window. She parts the Venetian blinds, looks out window, turns back 
       into room. She rushes to upstage side of bed, gets down on hands and knees, 
       pulls a suitcase out from under bed, throws on top of bed, opens it. She rushes 
       into bathroom, disappears, leaving door open. She comes back on with various 
       items of clothing, throws stuff in suitcase, turns as if to go back into 
       bathroom. Stops. She hears Eddie off left. She quickly shuts suitcase, slides it 
       under bed again, rushes around to downstage side of bed. Sits on bed. Stands 
       again. Rushes back into bathroom, returns with hairbrush, slams bathroom door. 
       Starts brushing her hair as though that&#39;s what she&#39;s been doing all 
       along. She sits on bed brushing her hair. Eddie enters stage left, slams door 
       behind him, door booms. He stands there holding a ten gauge shotgun in one hand 
       and a bottle of tequila in the other. He moves toward bed, tosses shotgun on bed 
       beside her.
      <p class=context>She stands, moves upstage, stops brushing her hair
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Oh, wonderful. What&#39;re you gonna&#39; do with 
         that?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Clean it.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>He opens the bottle.
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>You got any glasses?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>In the bathroom.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>What&#39;re they doin&#39; in the bathroom?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Eddie crosses toward bathroom door with bottle.
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>I keep everything in the bathroom. It&#39;s safer.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>You want some a&#39; this?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>I&#39;m on the wagon.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Good. &#39;Bout time.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>He exits into bathroom. May moves back to bed, stares at 
       shotgun.
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Eddie, this is a very friendly person who&#39;s coming 
         over here. He&#39;s not malicious in any way.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Pause.
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Eddie?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Off right
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>WHere&#39;s the damn glasses?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>In the medicine cabinet!</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>What the hell&#39;re they doin&#39; in the medicine 
         cabinet!</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Sound of medicine cabinet being opened and slammed shut off 
       right
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>There&#39;s no germs in the medicine cabinet!</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Germs.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Eddie, did you hear me?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Eddie enters with a glass, pouring tequila into it slowly until 
       its full as he crosses to table down left.
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Did you hear what I said, Eddie?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>About what?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>About the man who&#39;s coming over here.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>What man?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Oh, brother.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Eddie sets bottle of tequila on table then sits in upstage 
       chair. Takes a long drink from glass. He ignores the old man.
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>First off, it can&#39;t be very serious.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Oh, really? And why is that?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Because you call him a &quot;man&quot;.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>What am I supposed to call him?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>A &quot;guy&quot; or something. If you called him a 
         &quot;guy&quot;, I&#39;d be worried about it but since you called him a 
         &quot;man you give yourself away. You&#39;re in a dumb situation with this guy 
         by calling him a &quot;man&quot;. You put yourself below him.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>What in the hell do you know about it.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>This guy&#39;s gotta&#39; be a twerp. He&#39;s 
         gotta&#39; be a punk chump in a two dollar suit or somethin&#39;.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Anybody who doesn&#39;t half kill themselves falling 
         off horses or jumping on steers is a twerp in your book.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>That&#39;s right.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>And what are you supposed to be, a &quot;guy&quot; or 
         a &quot;man&quot;?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Eddie lowers his glass slowly. Stares at her. Pause. He smiles 
       then speaks low and deliberately.
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>I&#39;ll tell you what. We&#39;ll just wait for this 
         &quot;man&quot; to come over here. The two of us. We&#39;ll just sit right here 
         and wait. Then I&#39;ll let you be the judge.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Why is everything a big contest with you? He&#39;s not 
         competing with you. He doesn&#39;t even know you exist.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>You can introduce me.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>I&#39;m not introducing you. I am definitely not 
         introducing you. He&#39;d be very embarrassed to find me here with someone else. 
         Besides, I&#39;ve only just met you.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Embarrassed?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Yes! Embarrassed. He&#39;s a very gentle person.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>Is that right? Well, I&#39;m a very gentle person 
         myself. My feelings get easily damaged.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>What feelings?</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Eddie falls silent, takes a drink, then gets up slowly with 
       glass, leaves bottle on table, crosses to bed, sits on bed, sets glass on floor, 
       picks up shotgun and starts dismantling it. May watches him closely.
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>You can&#39;t keep messing me around like this. 
         It&#39;s been going on too long. I can&#39;t take it anymore. I get sick every 
         time you come around. Then I get sick when you leave. You&#39;re like a disease 
         to me. Besides, you got no right being jealous of me after all the bullshit 
         I&#39;ve been through with you.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=context>Pause. Eddie keeps his attention on shotgun as he talks to her.
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>We&#39;ve got a pact.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>Oh, God.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message a">
       <p class=message-text><span>We hade a pact.</span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="message b">
       <p class=message-text><span>There&#39;s nothing between us now!</span>
