   <section>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p><span>To give others a brief summary of the idea and its goals, Sieve is 
      similar to existing social media and content aggregation services (I see it as 
      being most similar to Tumblr) but it:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Supports only open standards (RSS!)</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Prioritizes content, has few or no social features whatsoever</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Views are content-specific, because the best view for images is not the 
       best for video, audio, or articles</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> The recommendation engine doesn&#39;t track users or collect any user 
       data; it functions only by examining content you&#39;ve saved.</span>
    </ul>
    <section>

    <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Aggregates content from the user&#39;s other social media and content 
       feeds with little or no effort.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Filters incoming content and sorts it according to media type.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Views are media-first and are designed to prioritize focusing on 
       content rather than social interaction.</span>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Framework</h2>
    <p><span>Sieve aspires to serve as a feed for content aggregation and exploration,</span>
    <p><span>removing unnecessary distractions from other platforms while collecting</span>
    <p><span>and displaying their content.</span>
    <p><span>It allows for the viewing of other social media and content platforms in 
      one place</span>
    <p><span>from a variety of mediums -- video, audio, pictoral, and written.</span>
    <p><span>It provides multiple views conducive to each type of content to enhance 
      the</span>
    <p><span>exploratory experience, and allows for saving types of content for later</span>
    <p><span>as well as publishing such content to your own</span>
    <p><span>At first, this engine that will be self-hosted,</span>
    <p><span>and the self-hosted instance will independently generate content best for 
      you</span>
    <p><span>provided links to follow.</span>
    <p><span>To improve usability, this may extend to a service in which users</span>
    <p><span>can create their own workspaces and subscribe to the feeds of others 
      (&#39;meta-feeds&#39;),</span>
    <p><span>though the focus of this project is to provide a variety of different 
      ways to</span>
    <p><span>customize and display content.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>UX</h2>
    <p><span>Operationally, Sieve is an RSS feed reader -- but one that puts 
      multimedia content first.</span>
    <p><span>It can be provided feeds and can crawl the internet for topics similar to 
      those already</span>
    <p><span>in feeds via a web crawler and content aggregation system.</span>
    <p><span>The innovation here is the multiple views of content it provides -- while 
      attribution is</span>
    <p><span>important, other aspects of social content publication can be distracting 
      or addicting.</span>
    <p><span>Sieve doesn&#39;t have &#39;likes&#39;, &#39;follows&#39;, or 
      &#39;comments&#39; -- it seeks only to provide</span>
    <p><span>different ways of viewing the content we already interact with on other 
      platforms.</span>
    <p><span>On the back end, Sieve scans each of the feeds a user follows to find a 
      cohesive</span>
    <p><span>&#39;theme&#39; or &#39;style&#39; from the content it displays, and 
      prioritizes displaying more</span>
    <p><span>of the content a user saves. It does not track you or learn from you in 
      any other way.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p><span>Sieve is minimal first. No clutter.</span>
    <p><span>It puts the content first and hides all excess information,</span>
    <p><span>allowing for &#39;focused&#39; inspiration without potential 
      distractions.</span>
    <p><span>Previous efforts with seamless, content-first design include Archillect.</span>
    <p><span>This project seeks to avoid creating a new Tumblr, Instagram or Facebook 
      --</span>
    <p><span>those platforms have become too bloated and interaction-driven.</span>
    <p><span>This platform seeks to minimize interaction with other users</span>
    <p><span>and instead prioritize interaction with their content.</span>
    <p><span>These distractions are deliberately obfuscated,</span>
    <p><span>hidden behind menus and obscured by a minimal interface -- the content 
      itself.</span>
    <p><span>There are no notifications, no numbers, no flashing visual cues</span>
    <p><span>to indicate additional information, as these are flaws that all make 
      social</span>
    <p><span>media content more addictive. It&#39;s as simple as visiting a page and 
      viewing</span>
    <p><span>content catered to the user.</span>
    <section>
     <h3>Image View</h3>
     <p><span>The image view presents itself as a multipanel scrolling feed of 
       image-based content.</span>
     <p><span>This scrolling can be infinite or paginated. I&#39;ll likely implement 
       the latter first.</span>
     <p><span>Images can be clicked to open a larger view of the image and to view 
       attribution if available.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Video View</h3>
     <p><span>This is probably the trickiest to get right; it may end up being</span>
     <p><span>an image view with GIFs instead of just images,</span>
     <p><span>but that would disparage any audio content that the videos may contain.</span>
     <p><span>The information density of audio in videos is much worse than audio in 
       isolation,</span>
     <p><span>so playing audio may not be relevant to the content, but providing a 
       distraction</span>
     <p><span>free way to consume this content feels necessary.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Sound View</h3>
     <p><span>This view will be similar to the &#39;theatre mode&#39; that many 
       services already provide,</span>
     <p><span>showing an oversized album cover while playing a specific song.</span>
     <p><span>It&#39;ll focus on playing previews of songs rather than their entire 
       contents</span>
     <p><span>so that the media can be set aside and continue to be consumed on another 
       platform.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Article View</h3>
     <p><span>RSS is overwhelming and often doesn&#39;t present the information 
       you&#39;re interested in --</span>
     <p><span>even good writers are bad at summarizing their own content and 
       prioritizing the information</span>
     <p><span>that readers want, and often blogs address a variety of topics rather 
       than focusing on</span>
     <p><span>a subset of articles that a specific reader may be interested in reading.</span>
     <p><span>As such, the article view aims to do a few things that other services 
       currently do not accomplish:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Generate a summary of the content provided on the page</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Prioritize articles based on content of previously saved content</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Always use user-customizable feeds for such content</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span>These articles will be viewable through a &#39;reader view&#39; that the 
       article view provides.</span>
     <p><span>Advanced features for the article view include saving individual passages 
       as opposed to</span>
     <p><span>entire articles.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Categories</h3>
     <p><span>In addition to sorting based on type of media, users should be able to 
       identify categories that they&#39;re interested in. These categories are used by 
       the recommendation algorithm under the hood and content is tagged with one or 
       more of these categories when it enters Sieve.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Viewing Saved Content</h3>
     <p><span>This operates identically to the inspiration views, but it only shows 
       content you&#39;ve already saved.</span>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
    <p><span>I have several adjacent ideas that, while outside the scope of this 
      project,</span>
    <p><span>could be added in the future.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> A service for viewing your own, internal content in the same way</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> that users of Sieve consume external content.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> A way to &#39;sieve&#39; through integration with content on other 
       platforms,</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> including a bookmarking system that automatically determines the</span>
    <p><span> type of content that was bookmarks and places it in the appropriate</span>
    <p><span> place on the user&#39;s feed.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Productization</h2>
    <p><span>I believe this project to be a viable product.</span>
    <p><span>The open-source version will be provided entirely for free,</span>
    <p><span>and will provide the Sieve engine. No user accounts, following, liking, 
      etc. will be involved with this draft (federation might be cool in the far 
      future but it&#39;s by no means necessary). However, people will be able to try 
      out and use the service on an individual basis by hosting it themselves.</span>
    <p><span>The commercial features:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Views should be plugins. They can be associated with</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> a specific type of content and will display that content in a manner 
      best fit for it.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Users should be able to make their own accounts and start their own 
       inspiration engines for a fee or with advertisements interspersing their 
       content.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Users should be able to follow other users. Following other users adds 
       posts those users have saved to their own feeds; these posts then show that they 
       came through those users. This is as far as the social interaction on this 
       platform will go.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> External platforms should be added and supported; i.e. Instagram RSS 
       feeds through Bibliogram. The aggregation of external platforms is huge for 
       external users to hop on and start focusing on this platform.</span>
    </ul>

    <p><span>Sieve&#39;s search shouldn&#39;t help users find whatever they&#39;d

      wrapping a comonad. - what does this mean</span>
