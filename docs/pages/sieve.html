     <h1 class=title-top>Sieve</h1>
     <p><span>Sieve was an idea for a multimedia inspiration engine, largely inspired 
       by AI-driven solutions and some need to decrease the insane amount of 
       information that I was consuming at this point in time of my life. It&#39;s 
       definitely still viable, but to get off the ground is going to require a huge 
       amount of data plumbing, and it might get you banned from Instagram</span><i>
       Twitter</i><span>Social terms of service... APIs are being deprecated as 
       companies are less and less willing to allow you to access their stuff.</span>
     <section>
      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p><span>To give others a brief summary of the idea and its goals, Sieve is 
        similar to existing social media and content aggregation services (I see it as 
        being most similar to Tumblr) but it:</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Supports only open standards (RSS!)</span>
       <li><span> Prioritizes content, has few or no social features whatsoever</span>
       <li><span> Views are content-specific, because the best view for images is not the 
         best for video, audio, or articles</span>
       <li><span> The recommendation engine doesn&#39;t track users or collect any user 
         data; it functions only by examining content you&#39;ve saved.</span>
      </ul>
      <section>
       <h3>Prior Work</h3>
       <p><a class=external href=https://tumblr.com>[Tumblr]</a>
       <p><a class=external href=https://github.com/seenaburns/isolate>[Isolate image 
         browser]</a>
      </section>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Aggregates content from the user&#39;s other social media and content 
         feeds with little or no effort.</span>
       <li><span> Filters incoming content and sorts it according to media type.</span>
       <li><span> Views are media-first and are designed to prioritize focusing on 
         content rather than social interaction.</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Framework</h2>
      <p><span>Sieve aspires to serve as a feed for content aggregation and exploration, 
        removing unnecessary distractions from other platforms while collecting and 
        displaying their content.</span>
      <p><span>It allows for the viewing of other social media and content platforms in 
        one place from a variety of mediums -- video, audio, pictoral, and written.</span>
      <p><span>It provides multiple views conducive to each type of content to enhance 
        the exploratory experience, and allows for saving types of content for later as 
        well as publishing such content to your own.</span>
      <p><span>At first, this engine that will be self-hosted, and the self-hosted 
        instance will independently generate content best for you provided links to 
        follow.</span>
      <p><span>To improve usability, this may extend to a service in which users can 
        create their own workspaces and subscribe to the feeds of others 
        (&#39;meta-feeds&#39;), though the focus of this project is to provide a variety 
        of different ways to customize and display content.</span>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>UX</h2>
      <p><span>Operationally, Sieve is an RSS feed reader -- but one that puts 
        multimedia content first. It can be provided feeds and can crawl the internet 
        for topics similar to those already in feeds via a web crawler and content 
        aggregation system.</span>
      <p><span>The innovation here is the multiple views of content it provides -- while 
        attribution is important, other aspects of social content publication can be 
        distracting or addicting. Sieve doesn&#39;t have &#39;likes&#39;, 
        &#39;follows&#39;, or &#39;comments&#39; -- it seeks only to provide different 
        ways of viewing the content we already interact with on other platforms.</span>
      <p><span>On the back end, Sieve scans each of the feeds a user follows to find a 
        cohesive &#39;theme&#39; or &#39;style&#39; from the content it displays, and 
        prioritizes displaying more of the content a user saves. It does not track you 
        or learn from you in any other way.</span>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p><span>Sieve is minimal first. No clutter.</span>
      <p><span>It puts the content first and hides all excess information, allowing for 
        &#39;focused&#39; inspiration without potential distractions.</span>
      <p><span>Previous efforts with seamless, content-first design include Archillect. 
        This project seeks to avoid creating a new Tumblr, Instagram or Facebook -- 
        those platforms have become too bloated and interaction-driven.</span>
      <p><span>This platform seeks to minimize interaction with other users and instead 
        prioritize interaction with their content.</span>
      <p><span>These distractions are deliberately obfuscated,</span>
      <p><span>hidden behind menus and obscured by a minimal interface -- the content 
        itself.</span>
      <p><span>There are no notifications, no numbers, no flashing visual cues to 
        indicate additional information, as these are flaws that all make social media 
        content more addictive. It&#39;s as simple as visiting a page and viewing 
        content catered to the user.</span>
      <section>
       <h3>Image View</h3>
       <p><span>The image view presents itself as a multipanel scrolling feed of 
         image-based content. This scrolling can be infinite or paginated. I&#39;ll 
         likely implement the latter first. Images can be clicked to open a larger view 
         of the image and to view attribution if available.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Video View</h3>
       <p><span>This is probably the trickiest to get right; it may end up being an image 
         view with GIFs instead of just images, but that would disparage any audio 
         content that the videos may contain.</span>
       <p><span>The information density of audio in videos is much worse than audio in 
         isolation, so playing audio may not be relevant to the content, but providing a 
         distraction free way to consume this content feels necessary.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Sound View</h3>
       <p><span>This view will be similar to the &#39;theatre mode&#39; that many 
         services already provide, showing an oversized album cover while playing a 
         specific song.</span>
       <p><span>It&#39;ll focus on playing previews of songs rather than their entire 
         contents so that the media can be set aside and continue to be consumed on 
         another platform.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Article View</h3>
       <p><span>RSS is overwhelming and often doesn&#39;t present the information 
         you&#39;re interested in -- even good writers are bad at summarizing their own 
         content and prioritizing the information that readers want, and often blogs 
         address a variety of topics rather than focusing on a subset of articles that a 
         specific reader may be interested in reading.</span>
       <p><span>As such, the article view aims to do a few things that other services 
         currently do not accomplish:</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Generate a summary of the content provided on the page</span>
        <li><span> Prioritize articles based on content of previously saved content</span>
        <li><span> Always use user-customizable feeds for such content</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span>These articles will be viewable through a &#39;reader view&#39; that the 
         article view provides.</span>
       <p><span>Advanced features for the article view include saving individual passages 
         as opposed to entire articles.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Categories</h3>
       <p><span>In addition to sorting based on type of media, users should be able to 
         identify categories that they&#39;re interested in. These categories are used by 
         the recommendation algorithm under the hood and content is tagged with one or 
         more of these categories when it enters Sieve.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Viewing Saved Content</h3>
       <p><span>This operates identically to the inspiration views, but it only shows 
         content you&#39;ve already saved.</span>
      </section>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
      <p><span>I have several adjacent ideas that, while outside the scope of this 
        project, could be added in the future.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> A service for viewing your own, internal content in the same way that 
         users of Sieve consume external content.</span>
       <li><span> A way to &#39;sieve&#39; through integration with content on other 
         platforms, including a bookmarking system that automatically determines the type 
         of content that was bookmarks and places it in the appropriate place on the 
         user&#39;s feed.</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Productization</h2>
      <p><span>I believe this project to be a viable product.</span>
      <p><span>The open-source version will be provided entirely for free, and will 
        provide the Sieve engine. No user accounts, following, liking, etc. will be 
        involved with this draft (federation might be cool in the far future but 
        it&#39;s by no means necessary). However, people will be able to try out and use 
        the service on an individual basis by hosting it themselves.</span>
      <p><span>The commercial features:</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Views should be plugins. They can be associated with</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> a specific type of content and will display that content in a manner 
        best fit for it.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Users should be able to make their own accounts and start their own 
         inspiration engines for a fee or with advertisements interspersing their 
         content.</span>
       <li><span> Users should be able to follow other users. Following other users adds 
         posts those users have saved to their own feeds; these posts then show that they 
         came through those users. This is as far as the social interaction on this 
         platform will go.</span>
       <li><span> External platforms should be added and supported; i.e. Instagram RSS 
         feeds through Bibliogram. The aggregation of external platforms is huge for 
         external users to hop on and start focusing on this platform.</span>
      </ul>

      <h2>Search</h2>
      <p><span>Sieve&#39;s search shouldn&#39;t help users find whatever they&#39;d
