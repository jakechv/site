    <h2>SAT solvers</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>Cons</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Require input problem to be a propositional logic formula in 
        conjunctive normal form (CNF). This is not a natural way to express most 
        problems that require SAT</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Computing CNF formulas is often bad and hard so SAT solvers aren&#39;t 
        really at the right &quot;level&quot; for use by the working programmer</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Look up </span>
       <pre></pre><span> on google scholar - reveals lots of problems and tradeoffs that 
        can be made</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Why SMT over SAT?</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> SMT solvers allow more freedom in the expression of input problems - 
        support integers, fixed width floats, arrays and potentially other datatypes, as 
        well as common operations on those types, without requiring a specific normal 
        form!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> API that allows for the manipulation of the input formula exposed by 
        the solver, unlike strict</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>How do they work?</h3>
     <section>
      <h4>Bit blasting</h4>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Directly convert input formula into an equivalent Boolean formula in 
         CNF</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Limited to formulas where every data type has a finite set of values</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Need a SAT solver as a backend, any improvement to SAT translates 
         directly to an improvement to an SMT solver - so this is just additional tooling 
         around a SAT solver to make it much easier to use.</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h4>CDCL(T)</h4>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Definition: conflict driven cause learning - the algorithm employed by 
         most modern SAT solvers.</span>
