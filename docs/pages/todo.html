    <p><span>scrolling up in terminal with the mouse is inconsistent; when usign the 
      arrow keys, you continue to see the buffer, but when scrolling up with the mouse 
      you eventualyl hit a point at which we pass the scroll buffer and hit the prev 
      part of the terminal. this shouldn&#39;t be possible! i shoulds be able to 
      scroll up and do that too.</span>
    <p><span>this actually makes my job *simpler*; we can convert the keyboard scroll 
      handler to a text input (probably? how does this work with tui programs?) and 
      work thoruhg our stuff that wya.</span>

      feeling of inspiration.</span>
