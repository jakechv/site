   <p><span>idea chat: it works like setting up meetings.</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> what is your name?</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> what is this meeting for?</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>launches you into meeting with topic being title. this works just like 
     jitsi meet - you then share link to specific meeting for others to join the chat 
     for the specific topic.</span>
   <p><span>there are intentionally no fancy group features like discord or slack - 
     this is purely for synchronously hashing out ideas. if multiple smess chats are 
     open they are open in multiple tabs.</span>
   <p><span>if a chat is not used for 24h it is automatically archived. nobody can 
     chat in it anymore but all the links to ideas in the chat still work and new 
     links can be created. this is to prevent endless hidden idea chats and to ensure 
     that the chat stays on topic.</span>
   <p><span>archived chat may have different ui that helps browse history in a better 
     way. see the chatting with glue idea.</span>
   <p><span>the motivation behind this is to create something spontaneous and 
     synchronous for hashing out ideas - like you would with a video call or meeting 
     - but because it&#39;s chat only everything is documented and traceable. 
     inspired by synchronous meetings and mailing list archives - we want the 
     longetivity and traceability of a mailing list archive with the real time impact 
     of synchronous meetings and the sponteneity of a viral tweet (share idea from a 
     chat on twitter - &gt; implicitly invites others to chat - &gt; 1 click signup 
     to get into the chat room - no sign up concerns).</span>
   <p><span>It&#39;s worth noting that </span>
    <pre></pre><span> does not intend to be a production-grade solution. Rather, 
     it&#39;s a general framework to allow me to experiment with messaging ideas that 
     have been suggested for a variety of platforms. It&#39;s designed to be 
     temporary and incredibly configurable - an toolbox of ideas for an end user to 
     try rather than a polished product to be deployed at scale.</span>
