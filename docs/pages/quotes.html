     <blockquote>
      <p>The best way to measure how much you&#39;ve grown isn&#39;t by inches or the 
       number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point 
       average - though those things are important, to be sure. It&#39;s what 
       you&#39;ve done with your time, how you&#39;ve chosen to spend your days, and 
       whom you&#39;ve touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of 
       success.

     <blockquote>
      <p>What&#39;s the greater risk - letting go of what people think or letting go of 
       how I feel, what I believe and who I am?

     <blockquote>
      <p>I would like this to signal the end of &quot;wasted angst&quot; in my life: 
       I’ve never regretted anything so much as having particular individual worries, 
       in a certain sense anachronistic ones, whereas general worries, worries about 
       our time (or at any rate those that can be reduced to such: like your problem in 
       paying the rent, for instance) are so many and so vast and so much &quot;my 
       own&quot; that I feel they are enough to fill all my &quot;worryability&quot; 
       and even my interest and enjoyment in living. So from now on I want to dedicate 
       myself entirely to these latter (worries)

     <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;At midnight, alone on the shore. One moment more and then I shall set 
       sail. The sky itself has weighed anchor, with all its stars, like those ships 
       which at this very hour gleam throughout the world with all their lights and 
       illuminate dark harbour waters. Space and silence weigh equally upon the heart. 
       A sudden love, a great work, a decisive act, a thought which transfigures, all 
       these at certain moments bring the same unbearable anxiety, linked with an 
       irresistible charm. Is living like this in the delicious anguish of being, in 
       exquisite proximity to a danger whose name we do not know the same as rushing to 
       our doom? Once again, without respite, let us go. I have always felt that I was 
       living on the high seas, threatened, at the heart of a royal happiness.&quot;

     <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. 
       Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by 
       definition, not smart enough to debug it.&quot; 
      <cite></cite>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p>“It is an act of cowardice to seek from (or to wish to give) the people we 
       love any other consolation than that which works of art give us. These help us 
       through the mere fact that they exist. To love and to be loved only serves 
       mutually to render this existence more concrete, more constantly present to the 
       mind.&quot;

      <p>I no longer love blue skies. In fact, I now prefer grey skies. The drones do 
       not fly when the skies are grey. #+end_quote
