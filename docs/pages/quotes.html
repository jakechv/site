      <p><span>the greater risk - letting go of what people think or letting go of how i 
        feel, what i believe and who I am?</span>

      <p><a class=external href=https://blog.matsu.io/on-leaving>[src]</a>
      <p><span>would like this to signal the end of &quot;wasted angst&quot; in my life: 
        I’ve never regretted anything so much as having particular individual worries, 
        in a certain sense anachronistic ones, whereas general worries, worries about 
        our time (or at any rate those that can be reduced to such: like your problem in 
        paying the rent, for instance) are so many and so vast and so much &quot;my 
        own&quot; that I feel they are enough to fill all my &quot;worryability&quot; 
        and even my interest and enjoyment in living. So from now on I want to dedicate 
        myself entirely to these latter (worries) — but I am already aware of the traps 
        in this question and that&#39;s why for some time now my first need has been to 
        &quot;de-journalistize&quot; myself, to get myself out of the stranglehold that 
        has dominated these last few years of my life, reading books to review 
        immediately, commenting on something even before having to time to form an 
        opinion on it. I want to build a new kind of daily program for myself where I 
        can finally get into something, something definitive (within the limits of 
        historical possibility), something not dishonest or insincere (unlike the way 
        today’s journalist always behaves, more or less). For that reason I make several 
        plans for myself: ... to maintain my contacts with reality and the world, but 
        being careful, of course, not to get lost in unnecessary activities; and also to 
        set up my own individual work not as a &quot;journalist&quot; any more but as a 
        &quot;scholar,&quot; with systematic readings, notes, comments, notebooks, a 
        load of things I&#39;ve never done; and also, eventually, to write a 
        novel.&quot;</span>

      <p><span>midnight, alone on the shore. One moment more and then I shall set sail. 
        The sky itself has weighed anchor, with all its stars, like those ships which at 
        this very hour gleam throughout the world with all their lights and illuminate 
        dark harbour waters. Space and silence weigh equally upon the heart. A sudden 
        love, a great work, a decisive act, a thought which transfigures, all these at 
        certain moments bring the same unbearable anxiety, linked with an irresistible 
        charm. Is living like this in the delicious anguish of being, in exquisite 
        proximity to a danger whose name we do not know the same as rushing to our doom? 
        Once again, without respite, let us go.</span>
      <p><span>I have always felt that I was living on the high seas, threatened, at the 
        heart of a royal happiness.&quot;</span>

       <li><span> Camus, standing before the sea of Algiers.</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span>is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if 
        you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart 
        enough to debug it.&quot;</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span>is an act of cowardice to seek from (or to wish to give) the people we 
        love any other consolation than that which works of art give us. These help us 
        through the mere fact that they exist. To love and to be loved only serves 
        mutually to render this existence more concrete, more constantly present to the 
        mind.&quot;</span>

      <p><span>no longer love blue skies. In fact, I now prefer grey skies. The drones 
        do not fly when the skies are grey.</span>
