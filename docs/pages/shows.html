     <h3>Queen&#39;s Gambit</h3>
     <p><span>Beautifully done 1950&#39;s woman empowerment - but not about woman - 
       genius character develops into a star and navigates relationships with a 
       pragmatic view of the world but desparate one of the past.</span>

     <h3>FLCL</h3>
     <p><span>aka Fooly Cooly</span>
     <p><span>2000s anime; I love the soundtrack but the plot is nonsensical or 
       entirely absent.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h3>
     <p><span>Absolutely beatiful series. Killer opening theme that doesn&#39;t fit the 
       show at all. The pacing and visuals are artful; entirely different from any 
       comparable series.</span>
     <p><span>that ending really sucked though</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>FMA Brotherhood</h3>
     <p><span>True to the manga but skips all of the fluff - somehow improves on the 
       best moments. the retrospective did them some huge favors, and they were able to 
       perfect already one of the best manga out there</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Death Note</h3>
     <p><span>As expected, this is an incredible series. The third arc (could be 
       considered the second arc) notably trails off in quality relative to the second 
       arc or the first segment of the series as characters begin to lose dimension -- 
       though some of the characters have to develop flaws to some degree as the series 
       continues or there wouldn&#39;t be any resolution.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Erased</h3>
     <p><span>Poetic, simple series about someone who&#39;s hit a dead end making the 
       right decisions and changing his life. All of the characters are incredibly 
       fleshed out, and the depiction of trauma is almost poetic -- all of them, in one 
       way or another, garner sympathy from the watcher and you become invested in just 
       12 episodes. Not a moment is wasted, either; the series starts and resolves 
       quickly and all of the plot points are cleanly tied together.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Steins;Gate</h3>
     <p><span>This started incredibly slow and I didn&#39;t have the patience to 
       continue watching. The characters didn&#39;t feel comprehensive and didn&#39;t 
       have much depth to them; the same corny anime jokes were made so many times 
       within the first few episodes, and actual plot elements were few and far 
       between.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Parasyte</h3>
     <p><span>The series was very engaging and I loved the visuals. Wasn&#39;t the 
       biggest fan of how it ended, or of the explicit narration of the 
       &#39;meaning&#39; of the series that consumed most of the last episode, as this 
       was all implied throughout the show and could have been left that way. I&#39;ll 
       be reading the manga : )</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>The Great Pretender</h3>
     <p><span>Satisfying story. A bit predictable/implausible at the end and dragged on 
       quite a bit, but it was a fun watch. Super high quality production as 
       anticipated!</span>

     <h3>master of none s3</h3>
     <p><span>beautiful series about a breakup of a lesbian relationship. each plays 
       interesting roles in the relationship. some of the fights don&#39;t feel real, 
       they feel irrational, especially as instigated by a &#39;chemistry phd&#39; of a 
       character. beautiful cinematography snd a sweet ending, though the conflict 
       driving the narrative was honestly not very believable to me. cool/interesting 
       that so many characters in clinical roles were poc as well.</span>
