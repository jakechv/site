     <h1 class=title-top>Memory Safety</h1>
     <p><span>Ideas and articles on memory safety.</span>
     <p><span>We can design around it explicitly or implicitly in many ways, but 
       software developers must always be aware of the memory their system uses.</span>
     <p><span>Systems like Forth are interesting because they don&#39;t just abstract 
       over the stack machines - they *are* the stack machines. This means they give 
       the programmer direct, immediate knowledge of how much memory they&#39;re using 
       at a given time.</span>
     <p><span>Type systems that encapsulate memory are interesting, but by comparison 
       feel like a bit of a hack: we have some system A with some semantics, then we 
       graft system A&#39; over it by making some assumptions about system A, then we 
       enforce rules of system A&#39; by enforcing some system B that feels unrelated 
       to the domain A and the language for the domain A&#39;, but that enables 
       optimisations and these things. I&#39;m not entirely sure how to express the 
       feeling of fighting both against the type system&#39;s enforcement of memory and 
       against the language itself, but it deters experiments - and play is the point.</span>
     <p><a class=external href=https://verdagon.dev/blog/when-to-use-memory-safe-part-1>
       [Safety in Non-Memory-Safe Languages]</a><span> is interesting; it investigates 
       different proposed solutions investigated when abstracting over programming 
       languages. To me, the design of a good solution has a lot to do with how 
       developers think about what they&#39;re using - we want to give developers as 
       much information at the top level as possible while allowing them to choose to 
       focus on some things but not others at specific times (ideas vs. hardened 
       systems vs. optimisations, while giving the programmer all the information about 
       their ideas, their interfaces and how their code compiles and interfaces with 
       the GC). GC obscures, and optimisation engineers for GC&#39;d languages are 
       tweaking compiler flags, memorizing the bytecode generated by specific 
       functions, or rolling their own systems and toolchains to provide new 
       performance profiles for languages.</span>
     <p><span>But becoming an expert on how a programming language is written to 
       optimise it feels like a violation of the abstraction boundary the language was 
       created to erect in the first place!</span>
     <p><span>Mmapped memory management, though idiomatic on Unix systems, also feels 
       like a bit of a hack - it doesn&#39;t match the memory model of developers. 
       Nobody wants to think about how much memory operation X occupies, allocate space 
       for it, then execute the operation - they want to first a ccomplish the 
       operation however they can, then revisit their work and apply optimisation 
       constraints if we determine that this point in the code is the bottleneck.</span>

       [Generational References]</a><span> are new in Vale and seem to </span><i>feel</i>
      <span> both safer and more optimal than current solutions. Absolutely worth 
       learning more about. The fact that they&#39;re strongly considering branch 
       prediction optimisations here is a great idea.</span>

       specifically, optimizing theorem proving.</span>
