    <p><span>On working in the public.</span>
    <p><span>Problem: I want to work on ideas and collaborate with others.</span>
    <p><span>My data, however, is locked, as is the data of everyone else.</span>
    <p><span>We can&#39;t properly share information unless we learn in the public;</span>
    <p><span>we also have substantial issues learning about ourselves if we do not 
      track what we learn.</span>
    <p><span>Iteration on ideas is just as important as the initial ideas!</span>
    <h2>Learn in Public</h2>
    <p><span>Always create while working!</span>

      [article, from patio11]</a>
    <p><span>There is nothing wrong with day jobs! Some really enjoy them.</span>
    <p><span>If the job is right for you, that&#39;s wonderful.</span>
    <p><span>If the day job is not right for you, learn on your own.</span>
    <p><span>&quot;It is in the employee&#39;s personal insterest to stop selling 
      hours of labor</span>
    <p><span>and start renting access to his accumulated capital as soon as humanly 
      possible.&quot;</span>
    <p><span>In other words, to become valuable, you must accumulate valuable 
      experience,</span>
    <p><span>hard skills and trust, then leverage these to continue to be 
      constructive.</span>
    <p><span>If you end the week with nothing, nothing about your life will change!</span>
    <p><span>No matter how hard you work you&#39;ll come back the next week having 
      built another</span>
    <p><span>internal product or having worked with another internal system. This</span>
    <p><span>is not valuable to you, and as a student you should prefer pursuing 
      things you benefit from.</span>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <h4>Work where people can see you.</h4>
    <p><span> This is not exactly the same as &#39;working in public&#39;. Working in 
      public is working</span>
    <p><span> entirely on public projects, while working where people can see you is 
      working in spaces</span>
    <p><span> where your work will be seen, recommended and commended.</span>
    <p><span> + Work on places and projects with above-average visibility.</span>
    <p><span> You&#39;ll be most likely to be hired and more likely to be noticed.</span>
    <p><span> + Don&#39;t necessarily optimize for &#39;sexy&#39; projects; most 
      engineering work isn&#39;t &#39;sexy&#39;.</span>
    <p><span> Optimize for *impact* and optimize for *visibility*.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> If you cannot gain exposure at your day job, network actively to gain 
       exposure outside of it.</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> Talk about things you create and show them to people!</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><a class=external
      href=http://unicornfree.com/stacking-the-bricks>[&#39;Stack the bricks&#39;.]</a>
      <span> The individual who has accumulated an impressive appearance is really</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> one day at a conference talk, one day writing a good library and another 
      writing a blog post.</span>
    <p><span> &quot;Brick by brick, the wall gets higher.&quot;</span>

    <h4>Work on things you can keep</h4>
    <p><span>You rarely get to keep ours, bank them in the future, etc.</span>
    <p><span>Widespread employee ownership of the enterprice is an excellent 
      improvement,</span>
    <p><span>but the work you produce concretely matters more than the shares and 
      stakes you hold.</span>
    <p><span>Buying side projects with sweat equity may give you future financial 
      benefits,</span>
    <p><span>and there are real benefits to having an object that is *yours* to 
      curate.</span>
    <p><span>Make a standalone web prescence for open source libraries to give others 
      a stake in them.</span>

    <h4>Consumption can be valuable but creation moves you forward</h4>
    <p><span>Reading is valuable, but actually shipping something is so much more 
      valuable.</span>
    <p><span>&quot;You&#39;ll learn so much more shipping a failure than you&#39;ll 
      learn from reading about a thousand successes. And you stand an excellent chance 
      of shipping a success -- people greatly overestimate how difficult it is.</span>
    <p><span>Just don&#39;t end the week with nothing.&quot;</span>

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <p><span>Continue to ask myself whether my contributions are valuable, whether 
      they are noticed, and whether they could be touched by others.</span>
