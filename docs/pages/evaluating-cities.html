    <h1 class=title-top>Evaluating Cities</h1>
    <p><span>I have to make a large committment in life; concretely, I have to decide 
      where I am going to live in the future.</span>
    <p><span>How do I do this?</span>
    <p><span>I&#39;m a software developer by trade and amateur computer sciientist 9I 
      try to read PL papers...) so my intuition is to establish some framework and 
      identify circumstances based on that framework.</span>
    <h2>What&#39;s important to me?</h2>
    <p><span>I&#39;ve attempted to distill everything that matters to me about a space 
      to three factors:</span>
    <p><span>1. Convenient, public, social spaces. The fabric of a city is defined by 
      the elegance by which</span>
    <p><span> I was talking to Lisa yesterday, and she suggested that I could 
      &quot;just get a car and drive to places&quot;.</span>
    <p><span> I don&#39;t even consider this a possibility. Why not? Why don&#39;t I 
      want to own a car?</span>
    <p><span> Ownership and maintenance of a complex vehicle requires additional 
      reliance on people I have adversarial - rather than amicable - relationships 
      with. If I have a bike or something, I can be friends with the people at the 
      shop and they can help me develop the knowledge I need to fix my bike; if I 
      bring my car into the shop with some complex diagnostic issue, Ford Motor 
      Corporation or Tesla or BMW has to decrypt their hardware and undo their 
      proprietary locks on my system before digging into the guts, and they can&#39;t 
      tell me how to do any of this, so I&#39;ll have no agency. I&#39;m dependent on 
      them in an unfriendly, predatory way. We don&#39;t have a proper covenant of the 
      right to repair for many objects, so I must avoid every hole I can prevent 
      myself from getting trapped in in that respect.</span>
    <p><span> Also the car is a private space. One of the most important things in my 
      life is the elimination of private spaces. This is why I love coffee shops. I 
      love people and want to do things for them, and private spaces are traps: you 
      spend more money to have spaces by yourself. this is an etirely separate article 
      i am getting distracted</span>
    <p><span> public spaces are incredibly powerful because optimizing for random 
      interactions by far is the highest value practice i have right now, and 
      continuing to do this seems incrediblt useful</span>
    <p><span> the most powerrful tool you have at your disposal is your ability to 
      interact with and inspire otherp people, and everything you should accomplish 
      should therefore be for people in two ways: your work should empower other 
      people to do new things and think in new ways, and it should inspire people to 
      be able to accomplish those things themselves. (this is mostly a note to myself) 
      in other words, it should both make the complex seem very possible and allow 
      people to do complex things very possibly at the same time. that to me is beauty</span>
    <p><span> Also, the fabric of a city transforms immensely when the road is not the 
      primary vehicle of navigating a city. It is hard to explicitly evaluate this. 
      This seems similar to social policies like legalizing alcohol outside and 24H 
      parties in Berlin. This makes Berlin a city like no other in the world, aside 
      from the other historical reasons; new classes of socialization and environments 
      are exposed when we can do new things and have the places to do them.</span>
    <p><span>2. A creative scene. I like cool people and spending time with cool 
      people and having cool conversations. I want to feel cool and listen to cool 
      music. Now that I have this environment in Boston I refuse to rely on the 
      internet as a crutch for interacting with these people; if I can choose to live 
      wherever I want I will chose to live with them in real life.</span>
    <p><span>3. People who work passionately and work hard. This goes hand in hand 
      with the other, I suppose? How do I distinguish this from Point 2? I&#39;m not 
      really sure yet. I will continue to think....</span>
