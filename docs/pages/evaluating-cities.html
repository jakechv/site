     <h1 class=title-top>Evaluating Cities</h1>
     <p><span>How do I figure out where to live?</span>
     <p><span>My intuition here as an engineer is to establish some framework and 
       identify circumstances based on that framework.</span>
     <section>
      <h2>What&#39;s important to me?</h2>
      <p><span>1. Convenient, public, social spaces. The fabric of a city is defined by 
        the elegance by which</span>
      <p><span> I was talking to Lisa yesterday, and she suggested that I could 
        &quot;just get a car and drive to places&quot;.</span>
      <p><span> I don&#39;t even consider this a possibility. Why not? Why don&#39;t I 
        want to own a car?</span>
      <p><span> Ownership and maintenance of a complex vehicle requires additional 
        reliance on people I have adversarial - rather than amicable - relationships 
        with. If I have a bike or something, I can be friends with the people at the 
        shop and they can help me develop the knowledge I need to fix my bike; if I 
        bring my car into the shop with some complex diagnostic issue, Ford Motor 
        Corporation or Tesla or BMW has to decrypt their hardware and undo their 
        proprietary locks on my system before digging into the guts, and they can&#39;t 
        tell me how to do any of this, so I&#39;ll have no agency. I&#39;m dependent on 
        them in an unfriendly, predatory way. We don&#39;t have a proper covenant of the 
        right to repair for many objects, so I must avoid every hole I can prevent 
        myself from getting trapped in in that respect.</span>
      <p><span> Also the car is a private space. One of the most important things in my 
        life is the elimination of private spaces. This is why I love coffee shops. I 
        love people and want to do things for them, and private spaces are traps: you 
        spend more money to have spaces by yourself. this is an etirely separate article 
        i am getting distracted</span>
      <p><span> public spaces are incredibly powerful because optimizing for random 
        interactions by far is the highest value practice i have right now, and 
        continuing to do this seems incrediblt useful</span>
      <p><span> the most powerrful tool you have at your disposal is your ability to 
        interact with and inspire otherp people, and everything you should accomplish 
        should therefore be for people in two ways: your work should empower other 
        people to do new things and think in new ways, and it should inspire people to 
        be able to accomplish those things themselves. (this is mostly a note to myself) 
        in other words, it should both make the complex seem very possible and allow 
        people to do complex things very possibly at the same time. that to me is beauty</span>
      <p><span> Also, the fabric of a city transforms immensely when the road is not the 
        primary vehicle of navigating a city. It is hard to explicitly evaluate this. 
        This seems similar to social policies like legalizing alcohol outside and 24H 
        parties in Berlin. This makes Berlin a city like no other in the world, aside 
        from the other historical reasons; new classes of socialization and environments 
        are exposed when we can do new things and have the places to do them.</span>
      <p><span>2. A creative scene. I like cool people and spending time with cool 
        people and having cool conversations. I want to feel cool and listen to cool 
        music. Now that I have this environment in Boston I refuse to rely on the 
        internet as a crutch for interacting with these people; if I can choose to live 
        wherever I want I will chose to live with them in real life.</span>
      <p><span>3. People who work passionately and work hard. This goes hand in hand 
        with the other, I suppose? How do I distinguish this from Point 2? I&#39;m not 
        really sure yet. I will continue to think....</span>
