     <h1 class=title-top>Choosing A College</h1>
     <p><span>Here is some advice I&#39;ve compiled regarding selecting and attending a 
       university in the US.</span>
     <section>
      <h2>Finding Colleges</h2>
      <p><span>Though imperfect, the </span><a class=external
       href=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities>[US News 
        and World Report]</a><span> provides a fairly accurate guideline to the best 
        colleges in the US. Take the rankings with a grain of salt, but remember that 
        the ranking of the university has some significance:</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Universities with higher rankings typically have more funding for each 
         student</span>
       <li><span> College name recognition makes finding a job much easier and brings 
         desired companies to your school</span>
       <li><span> Higher rankings are likely to attract students of a higher caliber</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span>Rankings should by no means help you make your final decision, but 
        looking into the top colleges overall and in your field of interest will help 
        give you a better idea of what makes these schools appealing, and perhaps what 
        type of environment you would like out of those top choices.</span>
      <section>
       <h3>Do you have a particular interest in the field you would like to pursue?</h3>
       <p><span>If so, look at the faculty at each university who could be relevant to 
         your interests and more strongly consider colleges at which there is a 
         concentrated interest in a specific topic. Even if you do not have a specific 
         interest in a field, a department with a depth of knowledge in a particular area 
         is likely to enhance the potential for learning &#39;depth&#39; throughout your 
         undergraduate cirriculum.</span>
       <p><a class=external href=https://csrankings.org>[CS Rankings]</a><span>, for 
         example, is a website dedicated to tracking research output and weighting 
         institutions based on their graduate research strengths. Other disciplines have 
         similar rankings systems that can be looked at for guidance.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>What do you want to do outside of college?</h3>
       <p><span>The location of the university is one of the most important aspects of 
         the decision. It&#39;ll determine what you have access to in your free time, the 
         kind of people you&#39;ll connect with, the place you&#39;ll have the most 
         connections in and eventually could play a hand in the location of your 
         employment. Read a bit about the &#39;personality&#39; of the city or town that 
         each college resides in, watch some videos, and visit if you can. The 
         environment is the part of the college selection process that is most difficult 
         to quantify, and takes knowing a bit more about what you want to determine.</span>
       <p><span>If you&#39;re looking into a smaller school or a school in a small town, 
         make sure that the school or locale offers the resources to do things you enjoy. 
         You might be hard-pressed to find a golf course in Oberlin, Ohio, for example.</span>
       <p><span>If you don&#39;t have a strong urge to live in a given place, that&#39;s 
         fine -- you&#39;ll be able to better optimize for academic interests, and 
         you&#39;re likely to meet plenty of friends at any college you choose to attend.</span>
      </section>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Assembling a List</h2>
      <p><span>Now that you have a variety of colleges you&#39;re interested in, 
        it&#39;s time to get a bit more realistic.</span>
      <p><span>Applying to top schools with acceptance rates in the single digits is 
        more or less a lottery. Admissions staff spend as little as five minutes looking 
        at each application and colleges often select for a particular student profile 
        -- newsworthy accomplishments nonwithstanding, even the best candidates can lose 
        the college lottery.</span>
      <section>
       <h3>The Portfolio</h3>
       <p><span>As such, it&#39;s best to develop a &#39;portfolio&#39; of colleges with 
         a variety of different risk factors. Critically examine yourself, your scores, 
         and your extracirriculars and identify what colleges expect.</span>
       <p><span>Colleges are required to report their 25th percentile and 75th percentile 
         SAT and ACT test scores for admissions, and often describe what type of students 
         they&#39;re looking for on their websites. You can use this information in 
         conjunction with other resources (described below) to determine if a school is 
         right for you.</span>
       <p><span>These factors depend on the individual and their circumstances, but you 
         likely want a spread similar to the following, assuming applications to about 
         ten different schools:</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> 2-3 top schools. These are the best schools money can buy in your 
          field; the colleges you&#39;d love to attend. Your test scores are a match for 
          their high expectations and your extracirriculars may be considered by the 
          colleges as defining characteristics. Regardless of financial constraint, 
          it&#39;s important to apply to at least one &#39;dream&#39; institution -- 
          otherwise, you&#39;ll be left wondering what could have been.</span>
        <li><span> 3-3 &#39;match&#39; schools. These are good schools you feel your 
          profile is a good match for -- they have relatively forgiving acceptance rates 
          and your test scores are compatible with their expectations. You would be very 
          happy attending one of these schools, and they provide a good balance between 
          financial viability, quality of academics and other considerations.</span>
        <li><span> 2-3 &#39;safety&#39; schools. These are schools for which your test 
          scores are in the 75th percentile or higher. They have high acceptance rates 
          relative to your other choices and you&#39;re confident that you would be 
          accepted here. These may not be located in your favorite city, or may not have 
          the best ranked program, but they&#39;re good default options to pursue in case 
          your other applications don&#39;t go well.</span>
        <li><span> 1-2 &#39;scholarship&#39; schools. These schools are safety schools 
          that might not be as appealing academically, but carry financial benefit -- 
          they&#39;re schools that are very likely to provide a significant amount of 
          merit-based financial aid. UT Dallas is a notable example of this -- I&#39;d 
          recommend that everyone at least considers the school given their willingness to 
          provide significant scholarships to out of state and international students to 
          well-qualified students. Even if money is currently no object, financial 
          circumstances can always change and it&#39;s good to be prepared for such an 
          eventuality.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> </span><a class=external
        href=https://blog.prepscholar.com/colleges-with-full-ride-scholarships>[Here]</a>
        <span> is a good place to start for finding such schools.</span>
       <p><span>Unless you have a strong idea of what you want from your college 
         experience, it&#39;s a good idea to apply to a diverse group of colleges (in 
         terms of location, campus values and prestige) rather than focusing on a 
         particular type of school. After all, your perspective on what you want from 
         college will change during the application process and as acceptances (and 
         reality) start to kick in as decision day approaches.</span>

      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p><span>There are lots of good resources to look into regarding college 
        applications in the US. </span><a class=external
       href=https://reddit.com/r/applyingtocollege>[The Applying to College subreddit]</a>
       <span> and </span><a class=external href=https://collegeconfidential.com>[College 
        Confidential]</a><span> are both forums on which students, admissions 
        counselors, and parents seek and provide advice for students looking to find the 
        right college. These forums are the best place to seek answers regarding college 
        admissions.</span>
      <p><span>It&#39;s easy to become caught up in their obsession over ranking and 
        prestige. Your personal interests will </span><i>always</i><span> matter more 
        than a perceived ranking or reputation that a certain college holds.</span>
      <p><span>Specific admissions blogs can help you learn more about the individual 
        experiences of many college students, their individual college experiences and 
        their perspectives on the universities they attend. One of my favorites is the </span>
       <a class=external href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/">[MIT admissions blog]</a>
       <span> -- it has consistently great writing and genuine insight from MIT students 
        with a variety of backgrounds.</span>
      <p><span>The subreddits and Facebook groups for individual colleges (for example, </span>
       <a class=external href=https://reddit.com/r/neu)>[https://reddit.com/r/neu)]</a>
       <span>provide insight into the day to day lives of students on campus and can 
        help you feel out the campus culture. These are relatively easy to find -- just 
        look up the college&#39;s name on the appropriate platform.</span>
      <p><span>Do keep in mind that the students typically posting the most are 
        typically those with the most to complain about, though; read about complaints 
        students have, but don&#39;t take them for granted as attributes of the school.</span>
      <p><span>College &#39;vlogs&#39; or &#39;tours&#39; on YouTube are, in my opinion, 
        the best way to get a &#39;feel&#39; for the university; there tend to be a few 
        students at most schools passionate about making such videos and showcasing 
        their experiences. For example, </span><a class=external
       href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYaJoVxo88o">[here&#39;s one such video 
        made by a friend at Northeastern]</a><span>.</span>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Your Choice Doesn&#39;t Matter</h2>
      <p><span>Though this decision is an incredibly important one, don&#39;t spend too 
        much time worrying about it. Wherever you go, you&#39;ll be able to find a 
        community of those who with the same interests and professors who share your 
        academic passions. You&#39;ll warm up to the location too.</span>
      <p><span>College is just four years of your life; make the most of it, but 
        don&#39;t spend too much time worried. You&#39;ll have a good experience 
        regardless of where you end up.</span>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Do I need to go to university?</h2>
      <p><a class=external href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/">
        [article]</a>
      <p><span>it&#39;s hard to know who should take nontraditional paths, and many 
        people are looking for validation not to do so. realistically, this is the best 
        option for most people, both socially and academically.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Do I have things that I deeply want to spend a year of my life 
         exploring and working on?</span>
       <li><span> Do I have a way to support myself that leaves me time and energy to 
         grow?</span>
       <li><span> Can I really work self-directed for months at a time? Do I have 
         examples of me working hard on a personal project or learning without external 
         structure?</span>
       <li><span> Do I have or can I learn the skills I need to work on this project 
         independently?</span>
       <li><span> Do I have sources of community, peer support or mentorship for what I 
         want to do?</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span>Harder to make friends without university. Cultivating the ability to 
        focus independently for an extended period of time before heading to college is 
        ideal for many people to develop.</span>
