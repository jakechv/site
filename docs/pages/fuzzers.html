      <h2>John Regehr talk</h2>

       <h3>Fuzzer Types</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> generative fuzzers :: comes up with these things out of nowhere to try 
          test inputs</span>
        <li><span> mutation fuzzers :: tweak an existing corpus to develop new examples</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span>The structure of programs is often very ill-defined and vague. Fuzzing is 
         useful because it allows you to rigorously build a justified sense of confidence 
         that your code doesn&#39;t suck.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Code Differences</h3>
       <p><span>what&#39;s different about approaching the code?</span>
       <p><span>for one compiler, the generated code could stack overflow. forces you to 
         be super tight about catching corner cases earlier in the start rather than 
         actually just putting up with them without the fuzzing testing. gets you to dig 
         into these test cases more easily.</span>
       <p><span>outgrowth of test driven development - it&#39;s about being able to 
         define classes of test cases you care about and iterate on testing those cases</span>
       <p><span>you want to look for anything - crashes, things going wrong, etc...</span>
       <p><span>as you&#39;re writing the code, you embed test oracles (assertions, 
         primarily) within the code to dynamically check this! the weaker the language 
         the more you need.</span>
       <p><span>property testing and fuzzing are related; property testing is thought of 
         as fuzzing with more oracles - it allows you to describe the properties, whereas 
         fuzzing is thought of as more &#39;black box&#39;</span>
       <p><span>adjusting to languages with fewer guardrails, or type safety; ships the 
         responsibility to the testing, mostly.</span>
       <p><span>this is why gradual typing are so exciting! you can shift towards a fully 
         typed environment and ensure that you add the types later, saving you a </span>
        <i>ton</i><span> of the trouble of testing.</span>
       <p><span>don&#39;t invest a lot of work into generating test cases if you already 
         have a super rich corpus of text to have your fuzzer draw from</span>
       <p><span>c had lots of undefined behavior, so a very strong property had to be 
         enforced on the test code by csmith to ensure that the code generated was from a 
         defined subset of the c specification.</span>
       <p><span>need to impose structure on the testing - valid c++ is one of the most 
         difficult file formats.generators are so hard to write for not much benefit!</span>
       <p><span>what should be fuzzed? what doesn&#39;t matter?</span>
       <p><span>ideal workflow with fuzzing involved</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> project started from scratch</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> write genreators as you write the code. okay to throw away them if they 
         aren&#39;t scalable, continue to iterate</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> project you pick up: heavily depends on use case obviously</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span>don&#39;t fuzz if your code doesn&#39;t yet have the maturity to do it!</span>
       <p><span>fuzzing is just weak verificatio: it&#39;s a weak quantifier over all 
         possible inputs in the space of inputs. it&#39;s one of hte closest ways we can 
         get to formal verification without the effort to do it! most things are mostly 
         wrong and you need to fuzz them before proving them correct! only after fuzzing 
         does verification make any sense. always fuzz with assertions, too, now have a 
         decent specification for the system already after doing this fuzzing campaign!</span>
       <p><span>almost everything he does is about _people_ and making things better for 
         people! great programming language trend towards interactivity and ways to work 
         with you the way you want to work in code!</span>
       <p><span>Insight that makes creduce works across languages - alcohol and lisp? 
         shared syntax of block structure language - understands all of the braces at 
         some rudimentary level. has tokenizatio npass based on c tokenizer, but it works 
         half decently for other things?</span>
       <p><span>creduce:</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> smtlib files? works fine . there is another smtlib reducer. creduce is 
          pluggable and modular, plugs in a lot of reduction passes. could hack it to 
          delete a bunch of passes from c and replace them with other ones as needed. 
          can&#39;t work super well with other things, as it tries to label everything 
          with ssa values - very hard coded for algol, lisp or similar.</span>
        <li><span> JITs?</span>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li><span> what keeps us from doing automated testing in industry today? why do 
          you think people aren&#39;t using it more?</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> focus fuzzing on hot paths and common paths rather than all of the 
         paths. bad things: not prioritizing bugs, not being able to focus on things that 
         fuzzers care about. fuzzers can be </span><i>dynamic</i><span> - people 
         don&#39;t necessarily want static checking!</span>
       <p><span>DSL to specify what you care about - take advantage of what you care 
         about in testing! in general this is an incredible view on this program</span>
       <p><span>best advice for producing qulaity software, in general: use modern 
         languages, test rigorously, write proper fuzzer generators</span>
