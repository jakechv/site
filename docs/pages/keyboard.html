        (The dream is to converge on some keyboard layout then encode it in hardware, 
        trivializing any latency from a QMK-like system).</span>

      <h2>IDEA: configuration has two types of keymappings.</h2>
      <p><span>one is relative to the location on the keyboard, while another is 
        relative to the letter. i like mixing both of these. there should be some system 
        for allowing me to easily do the former? TODO: break this down into more 
        specific topics!</span>

       <p><span> - make it easy to do the things i can do in i3 on laptop already</span>

        <li><span> on this layer remap shift so that it opens capital greek letter</span>

       <p><span>what function keys or macros would be useful to me?</span>
       <p><span>emojis?? on my keyboard??</span>
       <p><span> introduce leader keys and macros to spit out some keyboard shortcuts,</span>
       <p><span>music, or important information</span>
       <p><span>explicitly document this somewhere</span>
       <p><span>dont be afraid to draw out specific layout!!</span>
       <p><span>obviously best action to take is planck or split keyboard, but the next 
         action</span>
       <p><span>to take is changing the keyboard layout to radically change the way the</span>
