     <h1 class=title-top>Macros Are Expressions Of Freedom</h1>
     <p><span>Metasyntactic levels are expressions of freedom. Simple rule sets are 
       freedom. This is what I love.</span>
     <p><span>Soccer. There is one rule for casual play: do not touch the ball with 
       your hands. Everything else follows, and all of the rules are develoepd around 
       this beautiful, simple principle. The structured game falls out from this very 
       simple idea.</span>
     <h2>Lisp</h2>
     <p><span>Everything is a list. Actually it turns out that even common lisp 
       doesn&#39;t have proper homoionicity lol, but if your program has a list and you 
       have this wild &#39;eval&#39; function that can evaluate a list, turns out you 
       can consdtruct the world. CPS is less important and actually distracting. CPS 
       feels like a rule that builds complexity rather than freedom; tools like call/cc 
       introduce another system of evaluation that is quite difficult to handle in 
       addition to the traditional one, and programmers wan the value in their head; 
       they don&#39;t want to have to think about all the continuations we have in the 
       current context, they just want to think about what i can get from what I have 
       right now and where it goes and to forget about the rest. &quot;CPS is for old 
       people&quot;. - Matthias Felleisen</span>
     <p><span>The biggest thing I don&#39;t like about lisp is that it obscures details 
       about the underlying system; it assumes some model of infinite memory.</span>

     <h2>Forth</h2>
     <p><span> Eveyrthing is a stack adn we have this simple stack machine that can do 
       anything. Insanely efficient, and unlike even lisp we don&#39;t need multuple 
       evaluation levels to properly metaprogram. We can just move functions around on 
       the stack! This is not dissimilar to tactics, in that tactics keep in mind some 
       order of application of a list of expressions and allow you to rearrange how 
       they&#39;re applied in a metaprogram when proving theorems. Is a metaprogram the 
       right word? I&#39;m not sure.</span>
     <p><span> I also like that stack langauges like forth, through their semantics, 
       implicitly develop a memory model of the underlying system.</span>
     <section id="(NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)"></section>
     <h2>DJing</h2>
     <p><span>DJing is just a macro system for music. You have these completed tracks 
       made by these beautiful artists, and you can approach whole-track modification 
       after these products can be completed, ev en adding in new songs and ideas on 
       top of them. You have this ver ysimple set of rules - you have control ovewr the 
       position of the track and the volume of the waveform at particular points. and 
       so much beauty falls out from that and from the music of others. djing is really 
       a social event, a conversation with those around you. provide them the energy to 
       hang out!</span>
     <p><span>You can get &quot;into the guts&quot; of DJing as much as you want, and 
       the same rules apply to every track! but it&#39;s this investigative, 
       descriptive process of breaking down the waveforms of a completed song and 
       extracting imperfect information from them. you&#39;re taking complete products 
       and dissecting them to form new thing</span>
     <section id="(NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)"></section>
     <h2>Prose</h2>
     <p><span>Writing is inherently unstructured and we can ascribe any structure we 
       want to it, which is beautiful. prose is unstructured conversation, and it&#39;s 
       important for everything to be a conversation</span>
     <section id="(NIL NIL NIL)"></section>
     <h2>Photography</h2>
     <p><span>reminds me of DJing; your role is only to highlight a particular 
       perspective. you can control the &quot;macro&quot; elements but not the micro 
       (photoshop can be avoided with better work and better practices!) and i love the 
       practice of using lightroom &quot;macros&quot; to adjust the environment 
       globally, and having some level of local change, but not being able to directly 
       modify everything locally. ie if i&#39;m taking a photo of a building i have no 
       ability to modify the building, i must just observe it and try to frame it in 
       the best way possible. this reminds me of worshipping, and maybe djing is 
       worshipping tracks, but it is also having a conversation with the space 
       you&#39;re inhabiting and with the creators, like programming</span>
