   <p><a class=external href=https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm>[EXWM]</a><span> is an </span>
    <a class=internal href=id:62a9456a-e08a-4dc4-8e9d-310deffdb720>{Emacs}</a><span> 
     window manager.</span>
   <p><span>It&#39;s a simple wrapper for X11 functions that allows for the user to 
     interface primarily with Emacs.</span>
   <p><span>It features workspaces, multimonitor support,</span>
   <p><span>i3-like keybindings, and works practically out of the box!</span>
   <p><span>It&#39;ll manage your external programs in native Emacs buffers as well.</span>
   <p><span>Unfortunately, as a result of the browser oligopoly, it&#39;s not 
     feasible to access many resources on the internet without a modern browser, so 
     I&#39;m making use of a</span>
   <p><a class=external href=https://github.com/walseb/exwm-firefox-evil>[Firefox 
     compatibility layer]</a><span> to allow for the use of Firefox&#39;s keybindings 
     through Emacs.</span>
   <p><span>My configuration can be found </span><a class=external
    href=https://github.com/jakechv/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.doom.d/modules/desktop/exwm>
     [here]</a><span>.</span>
   <p><span>Thankfully, even if I&#39;m not using EXWM, Emacs just displays an error 
     that &#39;another X window manager is running&#39; when the EXWM configuration 
     is loaded. It&#39;s no problem to keep</span>
   <p><span>the configuration in my dotfiles even when I&#39;m using bspwm or another 
     window manager.</span>
   <p><span>As I make more extensive use of org-mode, I find myself using fewer and 
     fewer tools outside of Emacs. I&#39;ve found that the tools I do use often have 
     Emacs plugins that allow them to be used as</span>
   <p><span>Emacs functions as well.</span>
   <p><span>Really, Emacs (and EXWM) are partial solutions to a more systemic issue 
     -- the way in which the Unix philosophy has lost its way on the modern Linux 
     system.</span>
