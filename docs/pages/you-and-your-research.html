      <pre></pre><span>There are wavelengths that people cannot see, there are sounds 
       that people cannot hear, and maybe computers have thoughts that people cannot 
       think.&#39;&#39;</span>

     <li><span> Shannon information theory?</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Hired as a clerk for the computers of people like Feynman and Shannon. 
       Kept asking &#39;why?&#39;</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> you must first tell yourself that you&#39;d like to do something 
       significant</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> there is always repitition we see in people who make impacts, like 
       Shannon. Partly luck but the only control we have over that is our circumstances</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> great work is not just &#39;brains&#39;; often the issue is with 
       articulation, a lack of an ability to access the language and forum necessary to 
       develop ideas</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> once you&#39;ve developed the courage to face - and solve - important 
       problems, you can - he postulates that this will lead to a stream of successes 
       if you stick to the method</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> the best stem work is often done early in the career while the best 
       literary work is often done late</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> do not define your scale by the problems you&#39;ve faced, Shannon 
       error</span>

    <p><span>Knowing lots of things isn&#39;t important.</span>
    <p><span>What is important is:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Knowing what you know and don&#39;t.</span>
