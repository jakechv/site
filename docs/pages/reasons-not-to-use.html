       laughing at people who &#39;just trust him&#39; with their data. Instagram, 
       Facebook, etc. WhatsApp is less bad, but is inherently supportive of this

       they will never open-source the product. </span>

     <h2>Spotify</h2>
     <p><span>They actively support DRM, a cause with good intentions (artists should 
       own their work) but terrible impact (people no longer own parts of their 
       computers).</span>
     <p><span>Spotify feigns egalitarianism by pretending to support independent 
       musicians, propping them up in spite of major labels, but in reality these major 
       labels leverage their distribution networks just as effectively internal to 
       Spotify</span>
     <p><span>Spotify&#39;s unique value ad is their set of carefully curated playlists 
       and recommendations - systems designed to promote Spotify and disposable singles 
       rather than artists, careers and concerts. </span>
     <p><span>Their effort to incorporate podcasts into their platform seeks to 
       assimilate podcasts into major labels or distribution networks, preventing them 
       from using any other channels and forcing fans to pay for their distribution 
       networks</span>
     <p><span>We need distribution channels that are artist-first</span>
