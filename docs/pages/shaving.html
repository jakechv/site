     <h1 class=title-top>Shave Report</h1>
     <p><span>I decided to shave most of the hair on my body (aside from my head) the 
       other day to assess whether it would help me move forward. Here&#39;s what 
       I&#39;ve learned.</span>
     <h2>Shaving is initially difficult</h2>
     <p><span>Trimming almost 23 years of hair from my body was much more difficult 
       than clearing my face. Often, large tufts of hair would peel off easily, but 
       considerable stubble would be left afterwards; i&#39;d then have to take a 
       second pass with much more pressure and focus with the Phillips OneBlade shaver 
       I used.</span>
     <p><span>It&#39;s possible that a different or disposable razor would have been 
       more effective than a vibrating one. I&#39;m opposed to the waste that 
       disposable razors require, but I&#39;ll consider using my more substantial razor 
       in the future. Something that doesn&#39;t require electricity might be 
       beneficial; slightly wet skin seems to be easier to shave than dry skin, 
       potentially because friction against the skin is reduced without preventing the 
       hair from being cut.</span>
     <section id="(NIL NIL NIL NIL)"></section>
     <h2>Visibility</h2>
     <p><span>Flaws in my skin are far more plain. More than one friend of mine noticed 
       the large scar on my left leg after shaving. Though the scar was easily visible 
       otherwise, it may have been obscured by the texture and color of the brown hair 
       on my leg. Now that this is no longer the case, the large seam and considerable 
       discoloration on my leg around the scar seem to stand out much more.</span>
     <p><span>To this end, it&#39;s far easier to monitor freckles, sun damage, and 
       other potential flaws on my skin without hair in the way. I look forward to 
       continuing to leverage this visibility in the coming months to improve my 
       skincare routine to remove small blemishes and acne as well as even my skin 
       tone. How I will approach this is to be determined, but I will certainly be 
       vetting some skincare papers and updating these notes with my findings.</span>
     <section id="(NIL NIL NIL NIL)"></section>
     <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
     <p><span>Overall my skin is far more sensitive. I think that I notice fluctuations 
       in temperature more precisely than I did before, and the textures that my skin 
       makes contact with are far more obvious. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t opt for the 
       cheap bedsheets this year - I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d have enjoyed them with 
       bare skin. Of vague concern is losing some sensitivity to touch overall because 
       I&#39;m more exposed in general - but I&#39;m not certain that my body will 
       accomodate in this way, as it hasn&#39;t so far.</span>
     <p><span>I wouldn&#39;t say that the environment is necessarily more stimulating, 
       though - previously, the friction of the hair itself was supplying some 
       stimulation to my skin, but all of the stimulation now comes from whatever my 
       skin is in contact with. This implicitly increases *awareness* of sensitivity 
       but not sensitivity itself, I believe, as there is no more noise filter masking 
       my skin from having some experiences.</span>
     <section id="(NIL NIL NIL NIL)"></section>
     <h2>Friction</h2>
     <p><span>I experience friction against my skin in a slightly different way. Prior 
       to shaving, brushing my skin against itself was a bit of a coarse experience - 
       my body hair would feel a bit &#39;rough&#39; against itself - but I didn&#39;t 
       feel any real friction.</span>
     <p><span>Without this hair, bodily movement - particularly around the armpit area 
       - feels much smoother most of the time, but there are particular movements 
       involving lots of skin-to-skin contact that seem to cause my skin to stick to 
       itself a bit - creating friction from skin to skin without the padding of hair 
       to help reduce this.</span>
     <p><span>Fortunately, shaven skin makes other processes far easier. Soap and 
       sunscreen can be applied seamlessly - I no longer have to scrub them in and 
       mitigate clumps of sunscreen in my hair, as there is nothing for the sunscreen 
       to clump around. This significantly accelerates the process of showering, 
       applying sunscreen and otherwise cleaning myself. Despite the time investment 
       necessary to maintain a clean-shaven body, given how much more seamless other 
       processes involving my skin have become, I believe that I&#39;m actually saving 
       time.</span>
     <section id="(NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)"></section>
     <h2>Closing</h2>
     <p><span>Shaving was an overall good decision. It&#39;s made me aware of minor 
       flaws in my skin that I can now work to help rectify, and experiencing 
       additional sensitivity gives me more information about my world, which is 
       generally good! Maybe I&#39;ll be able to estimate temperature more accurately. 
       Visually, it also reduces the noise that my skin has, which leaves room for more 
       tattoos or outfits with far more detail. I&#39;m looking forward to 
       investigating.</span>
