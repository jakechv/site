    <h2>Reddit Tree Navigation</h2>
    <p><span>Remember Prezi? You could click on different bubbles</span>
    <p><span>to navigate through a presentation nonlinearly, or could</span>
    <p><span>navigate it linearly with forward and backwards arrow keys.</span>
    <p><span>This has a lot of potential! Let&#39;s try it with Reddit threads.</span>
    <p><a class=external href=https://github.com/ssorallen/react-reddit-client>[An 
      example client to get started]</a>
    <section>
     <h3>UX</h3>
     <p><span>Visiting a reddit post and prefixing it with the reddit tree 
       website&#39;s URL opens a window with the post&#39;s contents at the top of the 
       webpage. Below this, there are lots of bubbles pseudorandomly scattered 
       throughout the page. Their sizes are by default weighted by the number of 
       upvotes on the comment, but they can be arranged by number of comments in the 
       thread branching from the comment or some other metrics (TBD).</span>
     <p><span>Each bubble has the username, number of upvotes, and the prefix of the 
       comment. They may have smaller bubbles visible to demonstrate the next layer of 
       comments in the tree.</span>
     <p><span>Clicking on one of these bubbles does one of two things (not sure yet):</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Moves the bubble to the top right of the screen</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Replaces the text of the reddit post with that of the comment opened</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span>Either way, the user now has access to a back button to go &#39;back 
       up&#39; in the tree (we define clicking on a bubble as &#39;going down&#39; the 
       tree), and they also can see all of the comments descended from the currently 
       open comment as first-class bubbles.</span>
     <p><span>Each of these pages will also havte a bubble with a plus sign on it in 
       the bottom right of the page; clicking this opens a bubble that fills most of 
       the screen, with the comment or post you&#39;re commenting on featured as a 
       smaller bubble above it (perhaps it&#39;s visible as a semicircle under this 
       bubble?). You can then make a reddit comment using the usual reddit facilities 
       for this.</span>
    </section>

     <h3>Production</h3>
     <section>
      <h4>MVP</h4>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Visit a specific url on the reddit tree view website to open a reddit 
         thread.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> View the post and each comment in a bubble.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Click a bubble to view the next level of comments.</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h4>Enhanced UX</h4>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Tree view can be accessed by prefixing a reddit URL thread with our 
         URL.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Post bubbles are sized proportionally to their number of upvotes or 
         some other ranking metric. You can see smaller bubbles around them that provide 
         an estimate of the number of comments in their assoc. thread.</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h4>Usable for Reddit</h4>
      <ul>
       <li><span> The user can log in and make comments themselves.</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h4>Complete Product</h4>
      <p><span>Rather than providing alternate views to individual threads, the program 
        can instead act as its own reddit client.</span>
      <p><span>The main page of the site functions just like Reddit&#39;s home page, 
        only with bubbles for each subreddit.</span>
      <p><span>The bubbles are weighted proportional to the number of new posts, 
        popularity of those posts or some other metric.</span>
      <p><span>When clicking on one of these subreddit bubbles, you open a secondary 
        bubble view that showcases each post in the subreddit.</span>
      <p><span>A UI is provided to make new posts in the subreddit from this page.</span>
      <p><span>Clicking on an individual posts opens the fleshed out idea above, 
        providing an alternative navigational experience for all of reddit.</span>

    <h2>Version Control for Music</h2>
    <p><span>Live coding is a good idea, but it&#39;s meant to be &#39;played&#39;;</span>
    <p><span>current solutions for persisting livecoding information require</span>
    <p><span>recording, which compresses all of the structural information associated 
      with the music, or meticulously copying and pasting code then saving it all.</span>
    <p><span>We can do better!</span>
    <p><span>A &#39;recording&#39; mode for a live coding environment could be 
      implemented.</span>
    <p><span>To start the recording mode, a new branch is created.</span>
    <p><span>Every time the file is updated and re-run, it&#39;s recorded as a git 
      commit in a project&#39;s commit history.</span>
    <p><span>The commit message has notation demonstrating how long a certain commit 
      was played (time from start of recording to first commit or from the last commit 
      to the current one).</span>
    <p><span>When done recording, you can switch back to the main branch. The new 
      branches are identified by a particular notation in the branch name to 
      demonstrate that they were automatically created.</span>
    <p><span>These recordings can be:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Played back. A menu is exposed to &#39;play&#39; each of the created 
       branches.</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> When a branch is played, its first commit is run through the music 
      interpreter for a specified amount of time, then the new commit is checked out 
      and re-run; this is identical to a user manually editing the file and updating 
      the played music, and tracks will only update if the code has been changed for 
      them.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Exported: this can be done in the same way tracks are played back.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Converted to linear tracks. You can &#39;export&#39; a branch to a 
       linear arrangement to make it easier to edit and turn into a complete song 
       without having to record it! This process generates the appropriate pauses in 
       between the different parts of the music and loops to ensure that the different 
       segments of the track are run at the right time and in the right order.</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> This allows artists to take live coding projects that have been 
      performed. convert them into full-fledged tracks, and export them without having 
      to perform them.</span>

       them</span>
     <p><span>then produce something -- blog post, slides, illustration to 
       contextualize the learning</span>
     <p><span>finally, share with others get feedback and perfect the opinion. can now

     <p><span>blog :: keep *logs* of different categories and ideas. expand them as 
       needed.</span>

    <h2>NEXT Experiments</h2>
    <p><a class=external href="https://garten.stordahl.dev/">
      [https://garten.stordahl.dev/]</a><span>some inspo</span>
    <p><span>A website, similar to a &#39;portfolio&#39;,</span>
    <p><span>that highlights a bunch of cool experiments I have going on</span>
    <p><span>with regards to web design.</span>
    <p><span>The main page, </span><a class=external
     href=https://experiments.chvatal.com,>[https://experiments.chvatal.com,]</a>
     <span>provides an interface for easily browsing each of these without using any 
      JavaScript (or minimizing its usage). It allows users to easily browse the 
      different sample applications -- potentially as inner HTML frames, but they 
      could be in amy form. Users should have access to a preview of the experiments 
      in some way.</span>
    <p><span>Regardless of presentation, the website should contain a folder of git 
      submodules -- each corresponding to one of the &#39;experiments&#39;. These 
      experiments are added to the final static site as links when the website is 
      uploaded as part of a CI action or similar, though this can initially be done 
      manually. Each submodule should display a website and should host itself in a 
      subdirectory of &#39;experiments&#39;.</span>

    <h2>NEXT Portfolio</h2>
    <p><span>I&#39;ve been thinking that my single page introduction isn&#39;t quite 
      enough for employers, and that it might be good to add a portfolio with writeups 
      to document each of my projects.</span>
    <p><span>Maybe I could do this in a cool, nonlinear way, like SSENSE does or 
      similar to how the minimal photography websites approach things.</span>
    <p><span>Think about how I can write about my projects and include them in a 
      portfolio.</span>
    <p><span>Ideally I link the repositories and the description for the project is 
      pulled from the README of each repository so I don&#39;t have to do any 
      additional writing. These READMEs should already include appropriate 
      screenshots, and whatever tool configures the portfolio website should be able 
      to render these. (It could also take the GitHub summary line and make that the 
      headline for the project!)</span>
    <p><span>Perhaps &#39;experiments&#39; and &#39;portfolio&#39; are one and the 
      same; perhaps &#39;experiments&#39; is completely abstract while 
      &#39;portfolio&#39; is concrete and professional. What&#39;s the best way to 
      tackle this?</span>

    <p><span>i think i like twitter and similar platforms as much as i do chat 
      interfaces;</span>
    <p><span>i wonderif there&#39;s a way to combine these ideas with those from 
      social media</span>

    <h2>hack idea: nixOS gui</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> tags ::</span><a class=internal
      href=id:daa67b15-02f6-42f7-a918-bc59216c70d6>{Nix}</a><span>, </span><a
      class=internal href=id:f1a963ac-291b-421f-8cf9-93d41292dda5>{Operating Systems}</a>
      <span> </span>
    </ul>
    <p><span>primarily leverages home-manager and that kind of thing</span>
    <p><span>allows you to pick different programs you want to install on your system 
      based on a nice gallery that supports a subset of the </span>
     <pre></pre><span> repo</span>
    <p><span>you can select your system type: e.g. arm, etc</span>
    <p><span>this should be for nontechnical users that want to use linux, so they 
      don&#39;t have to mess with nix&#39;s underlying data if they don&#39;t want to, 
      but they have a nice interface to their code a needed -- they can bring back up 
      their program launcher thing and add, update, or roll back programs and systems 
      as needed without touching the nix cli!</span>

    <h2>Personal calendar</h2>
    <p><span>I love calendly but wish it had integrations with other non-proprietary 
      software. Rebuild its interface (but more mininally) with the following 
      integrations:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Jitsi Meet for calls (with support for using a custom Jitsi server, as 
       needed)</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Smess chat meeting : ) - super powerful! Find a FOSS alternative to 
       Loom video? Or make one?</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> CalDAV - i want to be able to use an open source calendar rather than 
       Google Calendar BS.</span>
