This will be revised when the things I own don't really changefrom year to year.</p><h1 id="temp">Temp</h1><p>Items I bring with me everywhere.</p><ul><li>Keys</li><li>Wallet</li><li>Camera</li><li>Phone</li><li>Earbuds(?)</li></ul><h1 id="daily">Daily</h1><p>Items I take with my every day – to work or out on a Saturday.</p><ul><li>Bag</li><li>Laptop</li><li>Headphones (?)</li><li>Notebook</li><li>Pen/Pencil</li><li>Charger</li></ul><h1 id="weekly">Weekly</h1><p>Items I'd like to bring with me on trips that last from a few days to aweek for weekend or weeklong trips. This could feasibly last longer thana week but may not be the most comfortable for long term. Essentiallythis is anything that will require packing clothing.</p><ul><li>Jacket</li><li>Tee(s)</li><li>Pants</li></ul><h1 id="indefinitely">Indefinitely</h1><p>Items I'd like to have with me for a long period of time. These itemswill help me live in a place longer term.</p><ul><li>Extra monitors</li><li>Variety of clothes</li><li>Laptop dock</li></ul><h1 id="permanent">Permanent</h1><p>Items I would like to keep but am not actively concerned with. Theybelong at my home base – I'm good as long as I have them storedsomewhere and can access them at all.</p><p>These items include investments, memorabilia and personal documents.</p><h1 id="temp">Temp</h1><p>For now, I'll organize based on category. I find this method easier toinventory in the meantime.</p><h1 id="edcaccessories">EDC/Accessories</h1><p>Wallet<br />Big Skinny It's not pretty but it's the lightest wallet on the marketwith multiple spots for cards and different IDs. I dislike the fabric ofchoice and exposed stitching. Ironically, their rubber logo patch isthicker than the wallet itself (and not very attractive) so I've rippedit off.</p><p>Open to other non-folding wallet options that fit 5+ cards (transitpass, gov't ID, school ID, credit, debit, insurance) and with a pocketfor a decent amount of cash.</p><p>Keys<br />DSPTCH Key Fob Thing Actively considering other solutions, especiallythose with the wind up string thing.</p><h2 id="todo-other-accessories"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Other Accessories</h2><p>I've been somewhat considering items like a watch, bracelets, etc. but Ihave a hard time justifying their utility.</p><h1 id="writing">Writing</h1><p>Pencil<br />Pentel Orenz Nero Compact, feels great, auto-dispenses lead. (Closesecond: Uni Kuru Toga. Designs are worse and it's harder to use thepencil to sketch, but the rotating tip is a killer idea.)</p><p>Pen<br />Fisher Space Pen (with clip!) Writes everywhere, feels good, looksgreat.</p><p>Eraser<br />Uno Knockback I like having an eraser separate from the pen. Much betterquality and makes the experience much easier.</p><p>Notebook<br />Moleskine Classic Notebook - Black. 5x8.25 in. Squared layout. I haven'tdone much research into this either, but it's the perfect size for anotebook and I require something that's well-bound and has a hard coverfor writing without a proper surface.</p><h2 id="todo-digitizing-notes"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Digitizing Notes</h2><p>I am considering using an e-ink tablet (and corresponding stylus) forwriting instead of these items. However, the current technology is notmature or open enough to be practical.</p><h1 id="clothing">Clothing</h1><h2 id="socks">Socks</h2><p>Everyday<br />Balega (mix of low rise and mid rise). Best socks I've ever worn.Incredibly soft and comfortable, breathable, sweat wicking and the lowrise socks have protection for the back of the ankle that with someshoes is prone to abrasion.</p><p>Workout<br />Low-rise Smartwool socks. Super thin and merino wool is super durableand breathable, if a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>Formal<br />Currently I wear some cheap socks from TK-MAX or something. Wouldappreciate more formal socks from a company like Balega but haven't doneenough research.</p><h2 id="underwear">Underwear</h2><p>Daily<br />Uniqlo Airism boxer briefs. Incredibly comfortable, portable andcompact.</p><h2 id="shoes">Shoes</h2><p>Most shoes are left over from an obsessive interest in fashion. Now thatI am more interested in utility, as these shoes wear out I will look formore durable sneakers to wear for the longer term.</p><p>Casual<br />Nike x A Cold Wall Vomero 5 - Black Incredible looking bulky shoes. Ascomfortable as dad shoes but still accrue a ton of compliments.</p><p>Daily<br />Nike x Stone Island Sock Dart - Black The sillhouette of these shoes isenough to appear professional - I've gotten and attended interviews inthese sneakers! - but they're still casual and comfortable enough towear daily and outside of the office.</p><p>Workout<br />Adidas Boost Something. I honestly need new running shoes.</p><h2 id="pants">Pants</h2><p>Everyday<br />Enfin Leve Ametzu Great all-around pant. They look formal dressed up anddressed down they're similar to a standard jean. The Schoeller Dryskinfabric is killer.</p><p>Travel / Comfort<br />Enfin Leve Aldatze Baggy, futuristic pants that are super comfortable. Ifeel great wearing these everywhere and they look incredible. Again, theSchoeller Dryskin fabric is killer.</p><p>Lounge<br />Issey Miyake Homme Plisse Lounge Pants These pants are weightless andlook luxurious. The appearance of the pleats is unmatched.</p><p>I wear other pants as well but they pale in comparison to these. I'mlooking into pants from Outlier and Veilance as well, but I haven't hadthe opportunity to try them and they do not seem to be as interesting(Outlier) or as durable (Veilance) than my current pairs.</p><h3 id="todo-workout-pants"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Workout pants</h3><h2 id="todo-shorts"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Shorts</h2><p>I haven't found the perfect pair of shorts yet. I don't wear shortsoften but it would be neat to have an interesting pair. I'm interestedin good looking, breathable cargo shorts primarily. I also don't have anideal workout short yet.</p><h2 id="shirts">Shirts</h2><p>Daily<br />Costco multi-pack tees / H&M black tees. These tees are left over fromprevious purchasing mistakes, honestly. I'd like to replace these withmore flexible and wearable merino wool clothing. Primarily consideringOutlier tee shirts here.</p><p>Formal<br />A basic white oxford. Considering swapping this for something moreversatile and breathable from Outlier or Wool and Prince.</p><p>Fun<br />Shirts can and should be used for self-expression too.</p><ul><li>Y-3 Yohji Tee. Incredibly baggy shirt, folds super well on the body.Very cool graphic with a Yohji Yamamoto self-portrait. Avant garde.</li><li>Yung Lean Warlord Tour Tee. One of my favorite artists and anincredible black and white graphic.</li></ul><p>Fun shirts are shirts I may rotate out for others in the future when athome.</p><h3 id="todo-workout-better-basics"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> workout, better basics</h3><h2 id="outerwear">Outerwear</h2><p>All-weather<br />Nikelab ACG 2 in 1. Perfect jacket. Super flexible and waterproof. Comeswith the hood.</p><p>Hoodie<br />Cav Empt Heavy Hoodie - white stripe. This hoodie fits my body typeperfectly like no other hoodie I've tried has. I wish the hoodie were abit lighter so I could wear it in sunnier weather and so it was moreportable but the cut of the garment is unparalleled.</p><p>The other jackets I typically bring with me are a Y-3 SS14 'LightJacket' for lighter weather and an Adidas x Reigning Champ sampleoversized Coach Jacket. I love the look of both but in terms of utilitythey are super interchangeable – they add some variety to the closet,but I could live without them if need be. I also have a cropped sweaterfrom Urban Outfitters but that should be swapped out for somethinghigher quality as well for more formal settings.</p><h2 id="todo-portable-formalwear"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Portable Formalwear</h2><p>I'd like something weatherproof that won't stand out in a more formalsetting. This is something I'd also use as a layering piece over thehoodie when the weather is rough but I don't need or want somethingheavy duty. Veilance has made a variety of different overcoats andformal jackets that fit this description, but I'd like to try differentoptions in store before committing to one.</p><h1 id="tech">Tech</h1><p>Laptop<br />Dell XPS 13 This laptop is okay. I like the size and it's gotten methrough school, but I wish it had better Linux compatibility and betterbattery life in the long term. The build quality could be better too.Upgrade: likely Thinkpad X1 Carbon.</p><p>Another consideration I have is bringing around a smaller computer likea smartphone or Pi that I use for all of my computing, plugging thiscomputer into monitors docked at my workspaces as needed. This is onlyreally feasible when I have a stable long term working tactic.</p><p>Camera<br />Fujifilm X-T3 I love this camera. It gives me the same control I enjoyfrom film cameras but in a light, portable, digital body. Lens selectionis plentiful and lenses are small enough to be portable. Lenses:</p><ul><li>23mm F2 WR</li></ul><p>Strap: DSPTCH Camera Wrist Strap</p><p>Smartphone<br />Samsung Galaxy S9 Note: I haven't put much thought into my smartphone.As technology progresses I would like to use a Linux phone with NixOS ora technology with a similarly configurable build system but for nowAndroid seems best.</p><p>Headphones<br />Bose QC35 II The quintessential noise-cancelling headphones. They'rerecommended everywhere for a reason. I do wish that they had USB-Csupport like all of my other devices for ease of charging.</p><h2 id="todo-earbuds"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Earbuds</h2><p>Once true wireless earbud technology seems to have matured (esp. withnoise cancelling) I will be making use of earbuds instead of headphonesfor greater portability.</p><h2 id="todo-lenses"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Lenses</h2><p>It's fun to have just one camera lens to work with but the focal lengthdoesn't cut it for a lot of street work. I'm considering adding the 35mmF2 WR and/or 50mm F2 WR to my kit.</p><h2 id="todo-audio"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Audio</h2><p>If I want to record high quality audio or take video in the future, Ishould have a system for that. Sampling the audio of my environmentseems just as cool as taking photos of the environment; I'd want aportable recorder I could easily mount to my camera to take videos ifneed be.</p><h2 id="todo-cables"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Cables</h2><p>Obviously I have cables, but I'd like to put more thought into thecables I have. I don't really even know what cables I use as of now.</p><h1 id="bags">Bags</h1><p>Day Bag<br />DSPTCH Slingpack - Ballistic Nylon Though I use this bag daily, I'm notsuper happy with it. I wish the bag were lighter and offered moreorganization, but it's the best option I was able to find on the marketfor my use case (Laptop case, \~15L of space, dedicated space for pencilstorage, quick sling) that looks good.</p><p>Bagjack and older Veilance may have good options as well. I will saythat the module system and quick sling are killer – I likely will notnever purchasing a pack without a similar system.</p><p>Backpack<br />Cote et Ciel Nile - Obsidian Black I have mixed feeling about this bagas well. I love the capacity and flexibility of the bag – it's great forgrocery shopping and carrying large, unstructured items such as clothing– but the lack of organization is painful when traveling.</p><h2 id="todo-other-bags"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> other bags</h2><ul><li>A large, packable bag for carrying laundry, extra groceries</li><li>Bags for holding shoes during luggage. this could serve as laundry bagas well</li><li>A small transit bag (smaller than the day bag) for a camera and acouple of essentials When traveling this would serve as the case formy camera.</li><li>A nice looking suitcase (mine is fine but I want something that looksbetter)</li></ul><h1 id="cancelled-transportation">CANCELLED Transportation</h1><p>I'd like an item I can pack and bring with me to use as transportwherever I end up. This would be something like a small electricskateboard; it has to be flexible enough to pack in a medium-sizedsuitcase, but versatile enough to take me across much of a city andback.</p><p>Ideas:</p><ul><li>Boosted board mini x</li><li>Segway One S1</li></ul><h2 id="etc">etc</h2><ul><li>some way to convert 2xAAA or 2xAA to usb-c charging (may need to justbuy the battery charger…)</li><li>usbc to micro usb for charging (for now)</li><li>charging brick that allows you to plug in thunderbolt cable (moreflexible than having usbc cable tightly coupled to power brick; themac one may be the best here)</li></ul></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/pages/favorites.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
