<h1>Items</h1>
<p><span>Items I bring with me; always subject to change.</span>
<p><span>Eventually, once my life is better defined, I&#39;d like to organize my 
  possessions based on the following.</span>
<p><span>I want to be able to move to other places for long periods of time but 
  still have a &#39;home base&#39;.</span>
<p><span>Each level implicitly includes everything from the prior levels.</span>
<section>
 <h2>Temp</h2>

 <ul>
  <li><span> Bag</span>

</section>
<section>
 <h2>Weekly</h2>
 <p><span>Items I&#39;d like to bring with me on trips that last from a few days</span>
 <p><span>to a week for weekend or weeklong trips.</span>
 <p><span>This could feasibly last longer than a week but may not be the most</span>
 <p><span>comfortable for long term.</span>
 <p><span>Essentially this is anything that will require packing clothing.</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Jacket</span>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Tee(s)</span>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Pants</span>
 </ul>
</section>
<section>
 <h2>Indefinitely</h2>
 <p><span>Items I&#39;d like to have with me for a long period of time.</span>
 <p><span>These items will help me live in a place longer term.</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Extra monitors</span>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Variety of clothes</span>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Laptop dock</span>
 </ul>
</section>
<section>
 <h2>Permanent</h2>
 <p><span>Items I would like to keep but am not actively concerned with.</span>
 <p><span>They belong at my home base -- I&#39;m good as long as I have them stored</span>
 <p><span>somewhere and can access them at all.</span>
 <p><span>These items include investments, memorabilia and personal documents.</span>
</section>
<section>
 <h2>Temp</h2>
 <p><span>For now, I&#39;ll organize based on category.</span>
 <p><span>I find this method easier to inventory in the meantime.</span>
</section>
<section>
 <h2>EDC/Accessories</h2>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Wallet :: Big Skinny</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> It&#39;s not pretty but it&#39;s the lightest wallet on the market</span>
 <p><span> with multiple spots for cards and different IDs.</span>
 <p><span> I dislike the fabric of choice and exposed stitching.</span>
 <p><span> Ironically, their rubber logo patch is thicker than the wallet</span>
 <p><span> itself (and not very attractive) so I&#39;ve ripped it off.</span>
 <p><span> </span>
 <p><span> Open to other non-folding wallet options that fit 5+ cards</span>
 <p><span> (transit pass, gov&#39;t ID, school ID, credit, debit, insurance)</span>
 <p><span> and with a pocket for a decent amount of cash.</span>
 <p><span> </span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Keys :: DSPTCH Key Fob Thing</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> Actively considering other solutions, especially those with the</span>
 <p><span> wind up string thing.</span>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO Other Accessories</h3>
  <p><span>I&#39;ve been somewhat considering items like a watch,</span>
  <p><span>bracelets, etc. but I have a hard time justifying their utility.</span>
 </section>
</section>
<section>
 <h2>Writing</h2>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Pencil :: Pentel Orenz Nero</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> Compact, feels great, auto-dispenses lead.</span>
 <p><span> (Close second: Uni Kuru Toga. Designs are worse and it&#39;s harder to 
   use</span>
 <p><span> the pencil to sketch, but the rotating tip is a killer idea.)</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Pen :: Fisher Space Pen (with clip!)</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> Writes everywhere, feels good, looks great.</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Eraser :: Uno Knockback</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> I like having an eraser separate from the pen.</span>
 <p><span> Much better quality and makes the experience much easier.</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Notebook :: Moleskine Classic Notebook - Black. 5x8.25 in. Squared 
    layout.</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> I haven&#39;t done much research into this either,</span>
 <p><span> but it&#39;s the perfect size for a notebook and I require something</span>
 <p><span> that&#39;s well-bound and has a hard cover for writing without a proper 
   surface.</span>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO Digitizing Notes</h3>
  <p><span>I am considering using an e-ink tablet (and corresponding stylus)</span>
  <p><span>for writing instead of these items.</span>
  <p><span>However, the current technology is not mature or open enough to be 
    practical.</span>
 </section>
</section>
<section>
 <h2>Clothing</h2>
 <section>
  <h3>Socks</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Everyday :: Balega (mix of low rise and mid rise).</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> Best socks I&#39;ve ever worn. Incredibly soft and comfortable, 
    breathable,</span>
  <p><span> sweat wicking and the low rise socks have protection for the back of the 
    ankle</span>
  <p><span> that with some shoes is prone to abrasion.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Workout :: Low-rise Smartwool socks. Super thin and merino wool is</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> super durable and breathable, if a bit uncomfortable.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Formal :: Currently I wear some cheap socks from TK-MAX or something.</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> Would appreciate more formal socks from a company like Balega</span>
  <p><span> but haven&#39;t done enough research.</span>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>Underwear</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Daily :: Uniqlo Airism boxer briefs.</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> Incredibly comfortable, portable and compact.</span>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>Shoes</h3>
  <p><span>Most shoes are left over from an obsessive interest in fashion.</span>
  <p><span>Now that I am more interested in utility, as these shoes wear out</span>
  <p><span>I will look for more durable sneakers to wear for the longer term.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Casual :: Nike x A Cold Wall Vomero 5 - Black</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> Incredible looking bulky shoes.</span>
  <p><span> As comfortable as dad shoes but still accrue a ton of compliments.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Daily :: Nike x Stone Island Sock Dart - Black</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> The sillhouette of these shoes is enough to appear professional -</span>
  <p><span> I&#39;ve gotten and attended interviews in these sneakers! - but 
    they&#39;re</span>
  <p><span> still casual and comfortable enough to wear daily and outside of the 
    office.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Workout :: Adidas Boost Something</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> I honestly need new running shoes.</span>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>Pants</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Everyday :: Enfin Leve Ametzu</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> Great all-around pant. They look formal dressed up</span>
  <p><span> and dressed down they&#39;re similar to a standard jean.</span>
  <p><span> The Schoeller Dryskin fabric is killer.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Travel / Comfort :: Enfin Leve Aldatze</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> Baggy, futuristic pants that are super comfortable.</span>
  <p><span> I feel great wearing these everywhere and they look incredible.</span>
  <p><span> Again, the Schoeller Dryskin fabric is killer.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Lounge :: Issey Miyake Homme Plisse Lounge Pants</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> These pants are weightless and look luxurious.</span>
  <p><span> The appearance of the pleats is unmatched.</span>
  <p><span>I wear other pants as well but they pale in comparison to these.</span>
  <p><span>I&#39;m looking into pants from Outlier and Veilance as well,</span>
  <p><span>but I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to try them and they do not seem</span>
  <p><span>to be as interesting (Outlier) or as durable (Veilance) than my current 
    pairs.</span>
  <section>
   <h4>TODO Workout pants</h4>
  </section>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO Shorts</h3>
  <p><span>I haven&#39;t found the perfect pair of shorts yet.</span>
  <p><span>I don&#39;t wear shorts often but it would be neat to have an interesting 
    pair.</span>
  <p><span>I&#39;m interested in good looking, breathable cargo shorts primarily.</span>
  <p><span>I also don&#39;t have an ideal workout short yet.</span>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>Shirts</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Daily :: Costco multi-pack tees / H&amp;M black tees.</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> These tees are left over from previous purchasing mistakes, honestly.</span>
  <p><span> I&#39;d like to replace these with more flexible and wearable merino 
    wool clothing.</span>
  <p><span> Primarily considering Outlier tee shirts here.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Formal :: A basic white oxford.</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> Considering swapping this for something more versatile and breathable</span>
  <p><span> from Outlier or Wool and Prince.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Fun :: Shirts can and should be used for self-expression too.</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> - Y-3 Yohji Tee. Incredibly baggy shirt, folds super well on the body.</span>
  <p><span> Very cool graphic with a Yohji Yamamoto self-portrait. Avant garde.</span>
  <p><span> - Yung Lean Warlord Tour Tee. One of my favorite artists and an 
    incredible</span>
  <p><span> black and white graphic.</span>
  <p><span> Fun shirts are shirts I may rotate out for others in the future when at 
    home.</span>
  <section>
   <h4>TODO workout, better basics</h4>

 <section>
  <h3>Outerwear</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><span> All-weather :: Nikelab ACG 2 in 1.</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> Perfect jacket. Super flexible and waterproof. Comes with the hood.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Hoodie :: Cav Empt Heavy Hoodie - white stripe.</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> This hoodie fits my body type perfectly like no other hoodie I&#39;ve 
    tried has.</span>
  <p><span> I wish the hoodie were a bit lighter so I could wear it in sunnier 
    weather</span>
  <p><span> and so it was more portable but the cut of the garment is unparalleled.</span>
  <p><span> </span>
  <p><span>The other jackets I typically bring with me are a Y-3 SS14 &#39;Light 
    Jacket&#39; for</span>
  <p><span>lighter weather and an Adidas x Reigning Champ sample oversized Coach 
    Jacket.</span>
  <p><span>I love the look of both but in terms of utility they are super 
    interchangeable --</span>
  <p><span>they add some variety to the closet, but I could live without them if 
    need be.</span>
  <p><span>I also have a cropped sweater from Urban Outfitters but that should be 
    swapped out</span>
  <p><span>for something higher quality as well for more formal settings.</span>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO Portable Formalwear</h3>
  <p><span>I&#39;d like something weatherproof that won&#39;t stand out in a more 
    formal setting.</span>
  <p><span>This is something I&#39;d also use as a layering piece over the hoodie 
    when the</span>
  <p><span>weather is rough but I don&#39;t need or want something heavy duty.</span>
  <p><span>Veilance has made a variety of different overcoats and formal jackets</span>
  <p><span>that fit this description, but I&#39;d like to try different options in 
    store</span>
  <p><span>before committing to one.</span>
 </section>
</section>
<section>
 <h2>Tech</h2>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Laptop :: Dell XPS 13</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> This laptop is okay.</span>
 <p><span> I like the size and it&#39;s gotten me through school, but I</span>
 <p><span> wish it had better Linux compatibility and better battery</span>
 <p><span> life in the long term. The build quality could be better too.</span>
 <p><span> Upgrade: likely Thinkpad X1 Carbon.</span>
 <p><span> Another consideration I have is bringing around a smaller computer</span>
 <p><span> like a smartphone or Pi that I use for all of my computing,</span>
 <p><span> plugging this computer into monitors docked at my workspaces as needed.</span>
 <p><span> This is only really feasible when I have a stable long term working 
   tactic.</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Camera :: Fujifilm X-T3</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> I love this camera.</span>
 <p><span> It gives me the same control I enjoy from film cameras but in a</span>
 <p><span> light, portable, digital body. Lens selection is plentiful and lenses</span>
 <p><span> are small enough to be portable.</span>
 <p><span> Lenses:</span>
 <p><span> - 23mm F2 WR</span>
 <p><span> Strap: DSPTCH Camera Wrist Strap</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Smartphone :: Samsung Galaxy S9</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> Note: I haven&#39;t put much thought into my smartphone.</span>
 <p><span> As technology progresses I would like to use a Linux phone with NixOS</span>
 <p><span> or a technology with a similarly configurable build system but for now 
   Android seems best.</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Headphones :: Bose QC35 II</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> The quintessential noise-cancelling headphones. They&#39;re recommended 
   everywhere for a reason.</span>
 <p><span> I do wish that they had USB-C support like all of my other devices for 
   ease of charging.</span>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO Earbuds</h3>
  <p><span>Once true wireless earbud technology seems to have matured (esp. with 
    noise cancelling)</span>
  <p><span>I will be making use of earbuds instead of headphones for greater 
    portability.</span>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO Lenses</h3>
  <p><span>It&#39;s fun to have just one camera lens to work with but the focal 
    length doesn&#39;t</span>
  <p><span>cut it for a lot of street work. I&#39;m considering adding the 35mm F2 
    WR and/or 50mm F2 WR to my kit.</span>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO Audio</h3>
  <p><span>If I want to record high quality audio or take video in the future,</span>
  <p><span>I should have a system for that. Sampling the audio of my environment 
    seems just as cool</span>
  <p><span>as taking photos of the environment; I&#39;d want a portable recorder I 
    could easily mount to</span>
  <p><span>my camera to take videos if need be.</span>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO Cables</h3>
  <p><span>Obviously I have cables, but I&#39;d like to put more thought into the 
    cables I have.</span>
  <p><span>I don&#39;t really even know what cables I use as of now.</span>
 </section>
</section>
<section>
 <h2>Bags</h2>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Day Bag :: DSPTCH Slingpack - Ballistic Nylon</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> Though I use this bag daily, I&#39;m not super happy with it.</span>
 <p><span> I wish the bag were lighter and offered more organization,</span>
 <p><span> but it&#39;s the best option I was able to find on the market for my use 
   case</span>
 <p><span> (Laptop case, ~15L of space, dedicated space for pencil storage, quick 
   sling)</span>
 <p><span> that looks good.</span>
 <p><span> </span>
 <p><span> Bagjack and older Veilance may have good options as well.</span>
 <p><span> I will say that the module system and quick sling are killer --</span>
 <p><span> I likely will not never purchasing a pack without a similar system.</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Backpack :: Cote et Ciel Nile - Obsidian Black</span>
 </ul>
 <p><span> I have mixed feeling about this bag as well.</span>
 <p><span> I love the capacity and flexibility of the bag -- it&#39;s great for 
   grocery shopping and carrying large, unstructured items such as clothing -- but 
   the lack of organization is painful when traveling.</span>
 <section>
  <h3>TODO other bags</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><span> A large, packable bag for carrying laundry, extra groceries</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Bags for holding shoes during luggage. this could serve as laundry bag 
     as well</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> A small transit bag (smaller than the day bag) for a camera and a 
     couple of essentials</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> When traveling this would serve as the case for my camera.</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> A nice looking suitcase (mine is fine but I want something that looks 
     better)</span>
  </ul>
 </section>

 <h2>CANCELLED Transportation</h2>
 <p><span>CLOSED: [2020-11-16 Mon 20:28]</span>
 <p><span>I&#39;d like an item I can pack and bring with me to use as transport 
   wherever I end up.</span>
 <p><span>This would be something like a small electric skateboard;</span>
 <p><span>it has to be flexible enough to pack in a medium-sized suitcase,</span>
 <p><span>but versatile enough to take me across much of a city and back.</span>
 <p><span>Ideas:</span>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Boosted board mini x</span>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><span> Segway One S1</span>
 </ul>
 <section>
  <h3>etc</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><span> better toothbrush</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> travel razor</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> some way to convert 2xAAA or 2xAA to usb-c charging (may need to just 
     buy the battery charger...)</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> usbc to micro usb for charging (for now)</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> charging brick that allows you to plug in thunderbolt cable (more 
     flexible than having usbc cable tightly coupled to power brick; the mac one may 
     be the best here)</span>
  </ul>
