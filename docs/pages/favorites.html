     <h1 class=title-top>Items</h1>
     <p><span>Some old catalogue of the items I lived with daily.</span>
     <p><span>When initially written, I wanted to perscribe and plan everything about 
       my life; I&#39;ve since learned that you don&#39;t know what you want until you 
       live it. This will be revised when the things I own don&#39;t really change from 
       year to year.</span>
     <section>
      <h2>Temp</h2>
      <p><span>Items I bring with me everywhere.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Keys</span>
       <li><span> Wallet</span>
       <li><span> Camera</span>
       <li><span> Phone</span>
       <li><span> Earbuds(?)</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Daily</h2>
      <p><span>Items I take with my every day -- to work or out on a Saturday.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Bag</span>
       <li><span> Laptop</span>
       <li><span> Headphones (?)</span>
       <li><span> Notebook</span>
       <li><span> Pen/Pencil</span>
       <li><span> Charger</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Weekly</h2>
      <p><span>Items I&#39;d like to bring with me on trips that last from a few days to 
        a week for weekend or weeklong trips.</span>
      <p><span>This could feasibly last longer than a week but may not be the most 
        comfortable for long term.</span>
      <p><span>Essentially this is anything that will require packing clothing.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Jacket</span>
       <li><span> Tee(s)</span>
       <li><span> Pants</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Indefinitely</h2>
      <p><span>Items I&#39;d like to have with me for a long period of time.</span>
      <p><span>These items will help me live in a place longer term.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Extra monitors</span>
       <li><span> Variety of clothes</span>
       <li><span> Laptop dock</span>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Permanent</h2>
      <p><span>Items I would like to keep but am not actively concerned with. They 
        belong at my home base -- I&#39;m good as long as I have them stored somewhere 
        and can access them at all.</span>
      <p><span>These items include investments, memorabilia and personal documents.</span>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Temp</h2>
      <p><span>For now, I&#39;ll organize based on category. I find this method easier 
        to inventory in the meantime.</span>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>EDC/Accessories</h2>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Wallet :: Big Skinny</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> It&#39;s not pretty but it&#39;s the lightest wallet on the market with 
        multiple spots for cards and different IDs. I dislike the fabric of choice and 
        exposed stitching. Ironically, their rubber logo patch is thicker than the 
        wallet itself (and not very attractive) so I&#39;ve ripped it off.</span>
      <p><span> </span>
      <p><span> Open to other non-folding wallet options that fit 5+ cards (transit 
        pass, gov&#39;t ID, school ID, credit, debit, insurance) and with a pocket for a 
        decent amount of cash.</span>
      <p><span> </span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Keys :: DSPTCH Key Fob Thing</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> Actively considering other solutions, especially those with the wind up 
        string thing.</span>
      <section>
       <h3>TODO Other Accessories</h3>
       <p><span>I&#39;ve been somewhat considering items like a watch, bracelets, etc. 
         but I have a hard time justifying their utility.</span>
      </section>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Writing</h2>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Pencil :: Pentel Orenz Nero</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> Compact, feels great, auto-dispenses lead.</span>
      <p><span> (Close second: Uni Kuru Toga. Designs are worse and it&#39;s harder to 
        use</span>
      <p><span> the pencil to sketch, but the rotating tip is a killer idea.)</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Pen :: Fisher Space Pen (with clip!)</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> Writes everywhere, feels good, looks great.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Eraser :: Uno Knockback</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> I like having an eraser separate from the pen.</span>
      <p><span> Much better quality and makes the experience much easier.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Notebook :: Moleskine Classic Notebook - Black. 5x8.25 in. Squared 
         layout.</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> I haven&#39;t done much research into this either,</span>
      <p><span> but it&#39;s the perfect size for a notebook and I require something</span>
      <p><span> that&#39;s well-bound and has a hard cover for writing without a proper 
        surface.</span>
      <section>
       <h3>TODO Digitizing Notes</h3>
       <p><span>I am considering using an e-ink tablet (and corresponding stylus) for 
         writing instead of these items. However, the current technology is not mature or 
         open enough to be practical.</span>
      </section>

      <h2>Clothing</h2>
      <section>
       <h3>Socks</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Everyday :: Balega (mix of low rise and mid rise).</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> Best socks I&#39;ve ever worn. Incredibly soft and comfortable, 
         breathable, sweat wicking and the low rise socks have protection for the back of 
         the ankle that with some shoes is prone to abrasion.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Workout :: Low-rise Smartwool socks. Super thin and merino wool is 
          super durable and breathable, if a bit uncomfortable.</span>
        <li><span> Formal :: Currently I wear some cheap socks from TK-MAX or something. 
          Would appreciate more formal socks from a company like Balega but haven&#39;t 
          done enough research.</span>
       </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Underwear</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Daily :: Uniqlo Airism boxer briefs. Incredibly comfortable, portable 
          and compact.</span>
       </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Shoes</h3>
       <p><span>Most shoes are left over from an obsessive interest in fashion. Now that 
         I am more interested in utility, as these shoes wear out I will look for more 
         durable sneakers to wear for the longer term.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Casual :: Nike x A Cold Wall Vomero 5 - Black Incredible looking bulky 
          shoes. As comfortable as dad shoes but still accrue a ton of compliments.</span>
        <li><span> Daily :: Nike x Stone Island Sock Dart - Black The sillhouette of these 
          shoes is enough to appear professional - I&#39;ve gotten and attended interviews 
          in these sneakers! - but they&#39;re still casual and comfortable enough to wear 
          daily and outside of the office.</span>
        <li><span> Workout :: Adidas Boost Something. I honestly need new running shoes.</span>
       </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Pants</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Everyday :: Enfin Leve Ametzu</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> Great all-around pant. They look formal dressed up</span>
       <p><span> and dressed down they&#39;re similar to a standard jean.</span>
       <p><span> The Schoeller Dryskin fabric is killer.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Travel / Comfort :: Enfin Leve Aldatze</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> Baggy, futuristic pants that are super comfortable. I feel great wearing 
         these everywhere and they look incredible. Again, the Schoeller Dryskin fabric 
         is killer.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Lounge :: Issey Miyake Homme Plisse Lounge Pants</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> These pants are weightless and look luxurious. The appearance of the 
         pleats is unmatched.</span>
       <p><span>I wear other pants as well but they pale in comparison to these. I&#39;m 
         looking into pants from Outlier and Veilance as well, but I haven&#39;t had the 
         opportunity to try them and they do not seem to be as interesting (Outlier) or 
         as durable (Veilance) than my current pairs.</span>

       <h3>TODO Shorts</h3>
       <p><span>I haven&#39;t found the perfect pair of shorts yet. I don&#39;t wear 
         shorts often but it would be neat to have an interesting pair. I&#39;m 
         interested in good looking, breathable cargo shorts primarily. I also don&#39;t 
         have an ideal workout short yet.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Shirts</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Daily :: Costco multi-pack tees / H&amp;M black tees.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> These tees are left over from previous purchasing mistakes, honestly.</span>
       <p><span> I&#39;d like to replace these with more flexible and wearable merino 
         wool clothing.</span>
       <p><span> Primarily considering Outlier tee shirts here.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Formal :: A basic white oxford.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> Considering swapping this for something more versatile and breathable</span>
       <p><span> from Outlier or Wool and Prince.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Fun :: Shirts can and should be used for self-expression too.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> - Y-3 Yohji Tee. Incredibly baggy shirt, folds super well on the body.</span>
       <p><span> Very cool graphic with a Yohji Yamamoto self-portrait. Avant garde.</span>
       <p><span> - Yung Lean Warlord Tour Tee. One of my favorite artists and an 
         incredible</span>
       <p><span> black and white graphic.</span>
       <p><span> Fun shirts are shirts I may rotate out for others in the future when at 
         home.</span>

       <h3>Outerwear</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> All-weather :: Nikelab ACG 2 in 1.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> Perfect jacket. Super flexible and waterproof. Comes with the hood.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Hoodie :: Cav Empt Heavy Hoodie - white stripe.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> This hoodie fits my body type perfectly like no other hoodie I&#39;ve 
         tried has.</span>
       <p><span> I wish the hoodie were a bit lighter so I could wear it in sunnier 
         weather</span>
       <p><span> and so it was more portable but the cut of the garment is unparalleled.</span>
       <p><span> </span>
       <p><span>The other jackets I typically bring with me are a Y-3 SS14 &#39;Light 
         Jacket&#39; for</span>
       <p><span>lighter weather and an Adidas x Reigning Champ sample oversized Coach 
         Jacket.</span>
       <p><span>I love the look of both but in terms of utility they are super 
         interchangeable --</span>
       <p><span>they add some variety to the closet, but I could live without them if 
         need be.</span>
       <p><span>I also have a cropped sweater from Urban Outfitters but that should be 
         swapped out</span>
       <p><span>for something higher quality as well for more formal settings.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>TODO Portable Formalwear</h3>
       <p><span>I&#39;d like something weatherproof that won&#39;t stand out in a more 
         formal setting.</span>
       <p><span>This is something I&#39;d also use as a layering piece over the hoodie 
         when the</span>
       <p><span>weather is rough but I don&#39;t need or want something heavy duty.</span>
       <p><span>Veilance has made a variety of different overcoats and formal jackets</span>
       <p><span>that fit this description, but I&#39;d like to try different options in 
         store</span>
       <p><span>before committing to one.</span>
      </section>

      <h2>Tech</h2>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Laptop :: Dell XPS 13</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> This laptop is okay.</span>
      <p><span> I like the size and it&#39;s gotten me through school, but I</span>
      <p><span> wish it had better Linux compatibility and better battery</span>
      <p><span> life in the long term. The build quality could be better too.</span>
      <p><span> Upgrade: likely Thinkpad X1 Carbon.</span>
      <p><span> Another consideration I have is bringing around a smaller computer</span>
      <p><span> like a smartphone or Pi that I use for all of my computing,</span>
      <p><span> plugging this computer into monitors docked at my workspaces as needed.</span>
      <p><span> This is only really feasible when I have a stable long term working 
        tactic.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Camera :: Fujifilm X-T3</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> I love this camera.</span>
      <p><span> It gives me the same control I enjoy from film cameras but in a</span>
      <p><span> light, portable, digital body. Lens selection is plentiful and lenses</span>
      <p><span> are small enough to be portable.</span>
      <p><span> Lenses:</span>
      <p><span> - 23mm F2 WR</span>
      <p><span> Strap: DSPTCH Camera Wrist Strap</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Smartphone :: Samsung Galaxy S9</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> Note: I haven&#39;t put much thought into my smartphone.</span>
      <p><span> As technology progresses I would like to use a Linux phone with NixOS</span>
      <p><span> or a technology with a similarly configurable build system but for now 
        Android seems best.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Headphones :: Bose QC35 II</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> The quintessential noise-cancelling headphones. They&#39;re recommended 
        everywhere for a reason.</span>
      <p><span> I do wish that they had USB-C support like all of my other devices for 
        ease of charging.</span>
      <section>
       <h3>TODO Earbuds</h3>
       <p><span>Once true wireless earbud technology seems to have matured (esp. with 
         noise cancelling)</span>
       <p><span>I will be making use of earbuds instead of headphones for greater 
         portability.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>TODO Lenses</h3>
       <p><span>It&#39;s fun to have just one camera lens to work with but the focal 
         length doesn&#39;t</span>
       <p><span>cut it for a lot of street work. I&#39;m considering adding the 35mm F2 
         WR and/or 50mm F2 WR to my kit.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>TODO Audio</h3>
       <p><span>If I want to record high quality audio or take video in the future,</span>
       <p><span>I should have a system for that. Sampling the audio of my environment 
         seems just as cool</span>
       <p><span>as taking photos of the environment; I&#39;d want a portable recorder I 
         could easily mount to</span>
       <p><span>my camera to take videos if need be.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>TODO Cables</h3>
       <p><span>Obviously I have cables, but I&#39;d like to put more thought into the 
         cables I have.</span>
       <p><span>I don&#39;t really even know what cables I use as of now.</span>
      </section>

      <h2>Bags</h2>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Day Bag :: DSPTCH Slingpack - Ballistic Nylon</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> Though I use this bag daily, I&#39;m not super happy with it.</span>
      <p><span> I wish the bag were lighter and offered more organization,</span>
      <p><span> but it&#39;s the best option I was able to find on the market for my use 
        case</span>
      <p><span> (Laptop case, ~15L of space, dedicated space for pencil storage, quick 
        sling)</span>
      <p><span> that looks good.</span>
      <p><span> </span>
      <p><span> Bagjack and older Veilance may have good options as well.</span>
      <p><span> I will say that the module system and quick sling are killer --</span>
      <p><span> I likely will not never purchasing a pack without a similar system.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Backpack :: Cote et Ciel Nile - Obsidian Black</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> I have mixed feeling about this bag as well.</span>
      <p><span> I love the capacity and flexibility of the bag -- it&#39;s great for 
        grocery shopping and carrying large, unstructured items such as clothing -- but 
        the lack of organization is painful when traveling.</span>
      <section>
       <h3>TODO other bags</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> A large, packable bag for carrying laundry, extra groceries</span>
        <li><span> Bags for holding shoes during luggage. this could serve as laundry bag 
          as well</span>
        <li><span> A small transit bag (smaller than the day bag) for a camera and a 
          couple of essentials</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> When traveling this would serve as the case for my camera.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> A nice looking suitcase (mine is fine but I want something that looks 
          better)</span>

      <h2>CANCELLED Transportation</h2>
      <p><span>CLOSED: [2020-11-16 Mon 20:28]</span>
      <p><span>I&#39;d like an item I can pack and bring with me to use as transport 
        wherever I end up.</span>
      <p><span>This would be something like a small electric skateboard;</span>
      <p><span>it has to be flexible enough to pack in a medium-sized suitcase,</span>
      <p><span>but versatile enough to take me across much of a city and back.</span>
