The system has some interesting ideas like validatingrequests, queries, HTML and SQL, and has an inbuilt ORM for expressingdatabase interactions. It's also super easy to install with Nix!</p><p>Unfortunately, it's software developed on master without rigoroustesting practices and the documentation can be lacking at times (thoughit is very good for a research effort). In my limited time using theframework, I found that I would frequently struggle with errors relatedto bad parses; if I used the wrong syntax at some point, I would receivean error that felt incredibly inconsistent with the code I was writing -I wish the system had more logging to inform the user of where the erroroccurs at the least!</p><p>It's also clear that the framework operates entirely independent of anyprogress in the web development space â€“ which leads to some interestingideas but foregoes several nice-to-haves of current systems. Urweb,though, is in it for the long haul.</p><p>Ur/web <strong>does</strong> seem to have decent Emacs support, though I had someinitial trouble getting urweb-mode to run in Emacs out of the box.</p><h1 id="starting-out">Starting Out</h1><p>If you're starting and you're a beginner, don't bother with the manualat first. Install the \`urweb\` package with Nix (use a nix-shell!) andjump straight to the examples. I found that without the proper contextthe manual and reference weren't super useful; they focus on theprogramming language itself rather than the ecosystem surrounding webdevelopment, which is likely why you're using the framework.</p><p>Of course, once you're familiar with using the ecosystem, go back to thereference to learn more about the language!</p><h1 id="links">Links</h1><p><a href="https://github.com/urweb/urweb">the Urweb repository</a> <a href="http://www.impredicative.com/ur/demo/">the main demo asprovided in the repo</a> <a href="http://frigoeu.github.io/urweb1.html">a greatwriteup on why urweb is worthtrying</a><a href="http://expdev.net/urtutorial/">http://expdev.net/urtutorial/</a> decent tutorial <a href="https://github.com/bazqux/bazqux-urweb">ur/Web part of BazQuxReader sources</a> <a href="https://github.com/vizziv/UrLib">Useful Ur/Webfunctions.</a> <a href="http://www.impredicative.com/ur/">ur programming languages -web dev w this!</a></p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/pages/urweb.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
