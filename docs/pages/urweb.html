   <h1 class=title-top>Urweb</h1>
   <p><span>Ur</span><i>Web, or the Ur programming language and the Ur</i><span>Web 
     domain-specific language standard and library, is an ecosystem designed to 
     promote *very* safe </span><a class=internal
    href=id:c44cb88d-e082-429c-8045-6a4ad57d95d4>{web}</a><span> development. The 
     system has some interesting ideas like validating requests, queries, HTML and 
     SQL, and has an inbuilt ORM for expressing database interactions.</span>
   <p><span>It&#39;s also super easy to install with Nix!</span>
   <p><span>Unfortunately, it&#39;s software developed on master without rigorous 
     testing practices and the documentation can be lacking at times (though it is 
     very good for a research effort). In my limited time using the framework, I 
     found that I would frequently struggle with errors related to bad parses; if I 
     used the wrong syntax at some point, I would receive an error that felt 
     incredibly inconsistent with the code I was writing - I wish the system had more 
     logging to inform the user of where the error occurs at the least!</span>
   <p><span>It&#39;s also clear that the framework operates entirely independent of 
     any progress in the web development space -- which leads to some interesting 
     ideas but foregoes several nice-to-haves of current systems. Urweb, though, is 
     in it for the long haul.</span>
   <p><span>Ur/web *does* seem to have decent Emacs support, though I had some 
     initial trouble getting urweb-mode to run in Emacs out of the box.</span>

    <h2>Starting Out</h2>
    <p><span>If you&#39;re starting and you&#39;re a beginner, don&#39;t bother with 
      the manual at first. Install the </span>
     <pre></pre><span> package with Nix (use a nix-shell!) and jump straight to the 
      examples. I found that without the proper context the manual and reference 
      weren&#39;t super useful; they focus on the programming language itself rather 
      than the ecosystem surrounding web development, which is likely why you&#39;re 
      using the framework.</span>
    <p><span>Of course, once you&#39;re familiar with using the ecosystem, go back to 
      the reference to learn more about the language!</span>
