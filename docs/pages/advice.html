      <ul>
       <li><span> To be a successful creator, all you need are a few thousand true fans.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> These fans will buy anything you produce and will support you directly.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Aiming for 1,000 customers is much easier than aiming for a million

      <p><span> obscurity.</span>

       <li><span> Now, small towns have the internet: a way to satiate the interests of 
         those</span>

      <p><span> who would otherwise be isolated from their interests!</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Big corporations cannot deliver to these niche audiences and consumers! 
         The</span>

        to</span>

      <ul>
       <li><span> This path is another path to success: carve a niche, assemble a small</span>

     <h3>Dealing with Motivation: Jon Blow</h3>
     <p><a class=external href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7kh8pNRWOo">[maanaging 
       your own psychology, a potential barrier!]</a>
     <p><span>A variety of techniques for dealing with motivational issues!</span>
     <p><span>We&#39;re likely unhappy for the majority of the time that we are unhappy 
       in</span>
     <p><span>front of the computer.</span>
     <p><span>Be impervious as to whether ideas are true or false.</span>
     <section>
      <h4>You are not your thoughts: Physical States</h4>
      <p><span>We think of our personalities as being composed of our thoughts.</span>
      <p><span>However, this is a very small part of what it is like to be me.</span>
      <p><span>Can be trapped in thoughts: these thoughts feel hard to get away from.</span>
      <p><span>Before this, stand apart from your thoughts; distance yourself from them.</span>
      <p><span>Focus on what you see.</span>
      <p><span>Have some simple, sentence-style thoughts. Think of things that are</span>
      <p><span>completely emotionally uncharged; thoughts that do not connect to strong</span>
      <p><span>ideas.</span>
      <p><span>Do not sink completely into the thought.</span>
      <p><span>Realize that your thoughts change as you take in different parts of your</span>
      <p><span>environment. Most of your experience is not comprised by this thought.</span>
      <p><span>Step back from the thoughts that are happening. Do not be so enraptured 
        by</span>
      <p><span>them.</span>
      <p><span>Prod some of these thoughts: how long does it take for the thoughts to go 
        by?</span>
      <p><span>How heavy is the thought?</span>
      <p><span>Can you stop that thought and let it go or is there something that 
        happens</span>
      <p><span>when you try to do that?</span>
      <p><span>Focus your attention on a single thought. Close your eyes. What do you 
        feel</span>
      <p><span>about it? Is this a solid object or ethereal? Is it well-defined or is it</span>
      <p><span>indistinct?</span>
      <p><span>By dropping your intention in, you are able to feel past your layer of</span>
      <p><span>intention and analyze what has not been processed.</span>
      <p><span>Do not have an agenda when inquiring about this sensation. Learn more 
        about</span>
      <p><span>the sensation.</span>
      <p><span>The actual sensation is neutral; it is your interpretation of the 
        situation</span>
      <p><span>that is making it negative. It&#39;s very important to realize this.</span>
      <p><span>Blow evaluates a particularly painful experience -- food poisoning -- and 
        how</span>
      <p><span>he can separate his understanding of the pain and their reaction to it.</span>
      <p><span>We know this about pain! When we are cut, the nerve receives an impulse 
        and</span>
      <p><span>this impulse is recieved by the brain, which assigns negative sentiment 
        to</span>
      <p><span>these things.</span>
      <p><span>Look at the sensations that help you generate this negative state.</span>
      <p><span>There is probably some legitimage precedence for having developed a 
        habit, or</span>
      <p><span>a response; at some point, though, we must acknowledge that these 
        processes</span>
      <p><span>are not inherently necessary! We can then properly evaluate and control</span>
      <p><span>whether we make decisions based on this state.</span>
      <p><span>Always pinpoint the source of your emotions, whether positive or 
        negative.</span>
      <p><span>You are not your thoughts. Your thoughts are very small.</span>
      <p><span>Step back.</span>
      <p><span>Sensations are neutral. Your mind amplifies the sensations.</span>
      <p><span>Try evaluating negative exercises as neutral experiences.</span>

      <h4>The Lesson TO Unlearn</h4>
      <p><a class=external href=http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html>[paul graham]</a>
      <p><span>The most damaging thing you learned in school was to get good grades.</span>
      <p><span>Do not mistake genuine interest for proficiency and measurement of 
        learning.</span>
      <p><span>You should not have to prepare for a test; they should reflect your</span>
      <p><span>knowledge.</span>
      <p><span>Tests are hackable!</span>
      <p><span>It isn&#39;t that complicated! There is no complex game.</span>
      <p><span>Identify a need, make your product very good, and it&#39;ll be popular.</span>
      <p><span>Getting lots of users! People will recommend the product to their 
        friends!</span>
      <p><span>The way to win is not to hack the test. Don&#39;t face an artificial 
        test! Make</span>
      <p><span>people want to use your product!</span>
      <p><span>He avoided working for big companies because you win at these big 
        companies</span>
      <p><span>for hacking bad tests.</span>
      <p><span>Tests that aren&#39;t imposed by authourities, after all, are unhackable! 
        There</span>
      <p><span>is no trick or mindset behind taking advantage of them; they&#39;re 
        moving</span>
      <p><span>targets with lo clear answers.</span>
      <p><span>You don&#39;t have to play the game! You can make it by *doing good 
        work*.</span>

      <h4>Do Things That Don&#39;t Scale</h4>
      <p><a class=external href=http://paulgraham.com/ds.html>[article]</a>
      <p><span>Startups don&#39;t take off by themselves -- the founders make them take 
        off.</span>
      <p><span>By yourself:</span>
      <p><span>1. Recruit users manually.</span>
      <p><span> To grow your business naturally, you need to recruit! Aggresively!</span>
      <p><span> Shyness and laziness prevent people from doing this; wanting to write 
        code</span>
      <p><span> and seeing the small numbers of users. Those initial users are necessary</span>
      <p><span> for exponential growth!</span>
      <p><span>2. Get used to fragility. It&#39;s hard to balance a successful business, 
        and</span>
      <p><span> squeezing the margins will make hte difference between success and 
        failure.</span>
      <p><span> All startups are fragile! New startups can&#39;t be judged by the 
        standards of</span>
      <p><span> successful ones.</span>
      <p><span> It&#39;s okay to get things wrong. It&#39;s okay to fix things.</span>
      <p><span> It&#39;s hard to see where you&#39;re coming from.</span>
      <p><span>3. Delight. Don&#39;t just get users, make them happy! Make users know 
        that</span>
      <p><span> signing up with you is the best thing they could have done. Try too hard</span>
      <p><span> to make your customers happy.</span>
      <p><span>4. Experience. The user experience and quality of execution should be</span>
      <p><span> incredible. The product doesn&#39;t have to be great, but the experience 
        of</span>
      <p><span> being a user does. Over-engage with initial users, listen to them</span>
      <p><span> carefully and pay close attention to their opinions.</span>
      <p><span>5. Fire. Focus on a deliberately narrow market at first, then widen your</span>
      <p><span> breadth. Start with a subset of the market then quickly expand.</span>
      <p><span>6. Consult. Pick a single, initial user and use them as a mold for a user 
        to</span>
      <p><span> please. Recruit initial lukewarm users by using your software on their 
        behalf</span>
      <p><span> and perfect the user experience and theri end.</span>
      <p><span>7. Manual. You are your software. Do everything manually, then automate 
        it</span>
      <p><span> later! This enables a faster launch, and automating out of this loop 
        becomes</span>
      <p><span> trivial.</span>
      <p><span>8. Big. Don&#39;t do the big launch! Nobody remembers it! Need something</span>
      <p><span> unscalably laborious.</span>

       <h5>Deep Work: Jon Blow</h5>
       <p><a class=external
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ej_3NKA3pk&amp;app=desktop">[talk]</a>
       <p><span>Though all software feels different, at the root of it all this all feels 
         the</span>
       <p><span>same.</span>
       <p><span>The ideas you initially have will not be that deep; as such, the exciting</span>
       <p><span>things are at the surface level. First, understand the single exciting 
         idea</span>
       <p><span>and explore it.</span>
       <p><span>Initial actions primarily focus on working with the surface-level code;</span>
       <p><span>determine how to navigate the code, working with code at a top level. We 
         need</span>
       <p><span>to focus on learning how to communicate to the computer!</span>
       <p><span>Experienced programmers do not think about text; text is the application 
         of a</span>
       <p><span>drawn-out idea and a developed solution. A problem is decomposed into</span>
       <p><span>smaller, tractale problems, then these tractable problems can be 
         translated</span>
       <p><span>into code that has been approached before.</span>
       <p><span>The shape doesn&#39;t start anywhere! After having an idea, yo also need 
         to</span>
       <p><span>locate this starting point; from this starting point, you must then 
         locate a</span>
       <p><span>way from which you can navigate through the idea from this point. Not 
         finding</span>
       <p><span>the starting point is bad, worse than choosing the wrong starting point!</span>
       <p><span>Some moments of programming involve internalizing a task so far that 
         it&#39;s</span>
       <p><span>been practiced; after performing this task so many times, you become</span>
       <p><span>accustomed to translating this task into code without thinking about it! 
         This</span>
       <p><span>experience is incredibly powerful!</span>
       <p><span>This is more like an art than an engineering -- you are following an</span>
       <p><span>intuition, and this intuition carries you somewhere good!</span>
       <p><span>Often, we get trapped by our attention: if we are deeply focused on a 
         single</span>
       <p><span>way of thinking and operating at a level of abstraction, we are unable to</span>
       <p><span>switch contexts to another layer of abstraction very easily! Often 
         it&#39;s best</span>
       <p><span>to back up and reevaluate the big picture.</span>
       <p><span>Getting to the deep work comes from experience. You&#39;ll follow many 
         misguided</span>
       <p><span>paths and many ill-guided directions, but at the end of the day you will</span>
       <p><span>reach a deeper understanding of the topic at hand.</span>

        good life]</a>
      <p><span>According to stoicism, the good life is:</span>
      <section>
       <h5>The Good Life</h5>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Virtuous: depending on how well one can perform the function for which 
          they</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> are dedicated</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Negative visualization: the fear that bad things will eventually happy</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> isn&#39;t healthy!</span>
       <p><span> Forestall the adaptation process; stop taking things for granted and 
         desire</span>
       <p><span> what we already have, craving to make the most of our crrent system, our</span>
       <p><span> current time and our current situation. It would be best to take 
         advantage</span>
       <p><span> of opportunities for moving forward, but before making these decisions 
         it</span>
       <p><span> is most important to establish contentedness.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h5>Taking Control</h5>
       <ul>
        <li><span> We have control over our goals, but do not have complete or any control</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> over many events. We must learn to welcome what happens to us and trust</span>
       <p><span> that this occurs for the best.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Willpower is like muscle power. The more we exercise our willpower, the</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> more self-control we have over ourselves; the more self-control we have,</span>
       <p><span> the better we are able to direct our lives.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> It&#39;s important to reflect on your process.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> What are you spending time on?</span>
       <p><span> How did we feel over the course of the day?</span>
       <p><span> Did something disrupt our tranquility?</span>
       <p><span> Did we experience adverse feelings?</span>
       <p><span> Is there something I could avoid?</span>
       <p><span> Is there some action I could take to become more productive?</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h5>Daily Living</h5>
       <ul>
        <li><span> We are rewarded for working and interacting with other people in ways 
          that</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> are advantageous.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> We must operate on teh assumption that annoying people are fated to 
          behave</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> this way, and that this behavior is inevitable.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Insult:</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> The things themselves do not upset us, but rather our judgements about</span>
       <p><span> these things.</span>
       <p><span> - When insulted, evaluate the insult rather than the individual and 
         reserve</span>
       <p><span> a judgement made about this thing.</span>

      <h4>The Happiness Hypothesis</h4>
      <p><a class=external
       href=https://hoanhan101.github.io/2020/05/10/happiness-hypothesis>[article]</a>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Happiness is a combination of biological initial happiness, life 
         conditions</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> and voluntary activities. The challenge here is to understand your 
        initial</span>
      <p><span> happiness, pushing the life conditions and the voluntary activities to 
        make</span>
      <p><span> the most enjoyment of the happiness.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> To love well is to develop good relationships with others.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Once basic needs are met, money cannot buy additional happiness.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Luxuries adapt to what we require for ourselves; impure luxuries can 
         enable</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> us to spend more time with family, reduce commute and take longer</span>
      <p><span> vacations; these are the luxuries we should strive for.</span>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Things we choose to do should be things that fall to our strength.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Progress principle: pleasure comes from making progress towards a goal</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> rather than achieving it.</span>

       <h5>Unlimited Memory</h5>

         [article]</a>
       <p><span>Concentrate. Do one thing at a time! Exceptional work is associated with</span>
       <p><span>periods of deep concentration and focus.</span>
       <p><span>Always have a clear purpose. Why does it matter? How is it applicabl to 
         my</span>
       <p><span>life? How can it help me achieve my goals?</span>
       <p><span>Apply creativity to everything you learn! Make learning more fun, engage 
         more</span>
       <p><span>senses, and grant actions to images.</span>
       <p><span>Long-term memory can trap short-term information:</span>

      <p><span>We are most well set up for learning to fit into our cultures and 
        navigate</span>
      <p><span>them socially.</span>
      <p><span>We are often not able to think well enough to see that we are not 
        thinking</span>
      <p><span>well enough! This is the Dunning-Kruger effect.</span>
      <p><span>It&#39;s known that we can only deal with a small number of things at 
        once; we</span>
      <p><span>must limit the input we receive and focus only on the core idea at hand.</span>
      <p><span>&quot;You can&#39;t thinking about thinking without thinking about 
        something.&quot; -</span>
      <p><span>Seymour Papert. It will help to have issues and ideas, things to learn 
        about</span>
      <p><span>that require better procedures; then, navigating those procedures assist 
        you</span>
      <p><span>in developing better thinking procedures!</span>

    <h2>Do I need to go to university?</h2>
    <p><a class=external href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/">
      [article]</a>
    <p><span>it&#39;s hard to know who should take nontraditional paths, and many 
      people are</span>
    <p><span>looking for validation not to do so. realistically, this is the best 
      option</span>
    <p><span>for most people, both socially and academically.</span>
    <p><span>Some questions:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have things that I deeply want to spend a year of my life 
       exploring</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> and working on?</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have a way to support myself that leaves me time and energy to 
       grow?</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Can I really work self-directed for months at a time? Do I have 
       examples of</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> me working hard on a personal project or learning without external</span>
    <p><span> structure?</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have or can I learn the skills I need to work on this project</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> independently?</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have or can I learn the skills I need to work on this project</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span>independently?</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have sources of community, peer support or mentorship for what I 
       want</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> to do?</span>
    <p><span>Those who leave university may be disparaging their efforts to make 
      friends.</span>
    <p><span>However, the ability to focus independently for an extended period of 
      time</span>
    <p><span>before heading to college is ideal for many people to flourish.</span>
