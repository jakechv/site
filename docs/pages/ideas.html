   <p><span>uninteresting ideas are streamlined improvements to existing processes - 
     a better messaging app, or a better task organization framework, for example. 
     people can already do these things; you&#39;re shaving time off what they can 
     do, but it&#39;s unclear whether your lifetime spent building the tool is worth 
     the small process improvement you give to others, even though that imporvement 
     compounds - and you&#39;ll spend so much effort marketing the tool to convince 
     others to accept a minor process improvement. ultimately, though, other people 
     will be solving these problems.</span>
   <p><span>interesting ideas fundamentally change the way people interact with the 
     world outside the application or business process or paradigm that the service 
     operates in. uber changed the way that people navigate cities. airbnb (arguably) 
     changed the way that people travel. accelerating shipping makes it possible for 
     anyone to pass something off to anyone else. businesses can be built on it. 
     ecosystems can be built on it. this is why craigslist is beautiful. shipping is 
     a platform - it&#39;s infrastructure - transporting something from A to B. 
     it&#39;s a world with far less ownership - where people can rent things to each 
     other and return them by dropping them off at their nearest bodega.</span>
   <p><span>Next step is just collecting data. How fast can we ship across NYC? How 
     fast do people want to ship? Ideal pace is slower than </span>
   <p><span>UX? either &#39;fun&#39; -we enjoy giving things to our friends! - or 
     business - most efifcient way to get things from A to B, no questions asked.</span>

    <h2>doc viewer</h2>
    <p><span>tool able to view just a subset of a webpage: i.e. for an article only 
      view the text itself, the way the author intended, as the main body, separating

    <h2>incredibly painful experience onboarding and settuing up react etc.</h2>
    <p><span>it does not have to be this way.</span>
    <p><span>concretely: what&#39;s github? what&#39;s vscode? how do i open, view and 
      edit files? what&#39;s the difference between github, github desktop, vscode, 
      react native? what is nodejs for and what does it let us do?</span>
