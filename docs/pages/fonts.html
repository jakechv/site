       <ul>
        <li><span> Didot: :: &#39;Timeless elegance&#39;; old and sophisticated.</span>
        <li><span> Warnock :: Powerful with a lot of glyphs. It&#39;s an Adobe font and is 
          probably expensive.</span>
        <li><span> Trajan :: based on roman typography!</span>
        <li><span> Bembo :: Revival of monotype. Graceful, stable and elegant! More subtle 
          than a Didot.</span>
        <li><span> Futura :: A classic futuristic font. Can be seen in places like </span>
         <a class=external href=https://ableton.com>[Ableton&#39;s website]</a><span>.</span>

        <li><span> Caslon :: Organic, beautiful style -- check this one out!</span>
        <li><span> Freight Sans :: fun and cartoonish font feel.</span>
        <li><span> Open Sans :: The new sans font with a neutral, flat design.</span>
        <li><span> Gill Snas :: warm british, a bit tall, crisp lines</span>
        <li><span> Gotham :: New York signage lettering style.</span>
        <li><span> Bodoni :: luxe, aspirational look font. more compressed and exaggerated</span>

      <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
      <section>
       <h3>Design</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Motion Design :: Text in motion carefully chose to make text readable 
          in videos and other animations. This text isn&#39;t visible all the time; 
          rather, it&#39;s moving quickly and likely flashes past during a video.</span>
        <li><span> Variable Fonts :: One or more axes that provide variation between 
          different extremes of typeface design. These fonts allow for finer control over 
          the design as it changes across the design space! A font can often be installed 
          as regular, bold or both, and extended designs are expressed nicely. Formally, 
          this is a specification that allows for multiple fonts to be packaged in a 
          single file.</span>
        <li><span> typeface :: A particular design of type. A single group of fonts; a set 
          of fonts in the same style, or &#39;font family&#39;.</span>
        <li><span> font :: An instance of a typeface; a single weight of style within a 
          typeface family.</span>
       </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Type</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> baseline :: The line on which type sits.</span>
        <li><span> height :: THe distance from baseline to the top of the lowercase 
          letters, disregarding tall letters such as h.</span>
        <li><span> cap height :: The distance between a capital letter and baseline.</span>
        <li><span> ascenders :: The stem above lowercase letters that extends above the 
          alloted height.</span>
        <li><span> descenders :: Letters that extend below the baseline.</span>
        <li><span> stem :: The main stroke of the letter (usually vertical).</span>
        <li><span> tail :: Descending, decorative stroke on letters such as y and q.</span>
        <li><span> serif :: The flair extending off of the edge of letters.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> Defines a &#39;font family&#39; (serif vs sans serif).</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> counter :: The enclosed space within letters like o and g.</span>
        <li><span> ear :: The small extension on lower half of the letter g.</span>
        <li><span> terminal :: The end of a stroke without a serif.</span>
        <li><span> aperture :: Partially closed negative space in characters like c, s, 
          and n. This is always rounded.</span>
        <li><span> bowl :: The curved part of the character enclosing the circular or 
          curved parts of letters.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> This occurs in letters like o, d and b.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> kerning :: Adjusting the space between individual characters.</span>
        <li><span> tracking :: The spacing of a group of characters.</span>
        <li><span> alignment :: text should probably be left aligned</span>
        <li><span> justifying text :: adding a straight edge to text on boht sides</span>
        <li><span> measure :: length of lines of text in a paragraph of column (column 
          width)</span>
        <li><span> Leading :: Vertical line spacing. generating sufficient space between 
          lines to make it readable</span>
        <li><span> Ligatures :: Fusing characters that are next to one another that look 
          very similar.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span> These characters may look awkward when next to one another if they 
         aren&#39;t fused.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Hyphenation :: Breaking a word across a line and separating it with a 
          dash; a technique typically used to prevent rag problems.</span>
        <li><span> hyphen :: short dash &#39;-&#39;. used to divide words that break at 
          the end of the line or to connect parts of co mpound words such as 
          &#39;ill-fated&#39;. these are used to represent relationships between 
          individuals rather th an separating them.En-dash : slightly longer hthan the 
          hyphe. used to indicate a range of values, such as a span of time or numerical 
          quantities. sometimes the em-dash is used instead of the en-dash for aesthetic 
          reasons, or a sm all amount of space is added befoer or after the dash for 
          artistic purposes.Em-dash : longer than that!the em-dash is typically used to 
          indicate a break in thought, and is normally followed with and preceded by 
          space. It can be used to describe a thought within a sentence as well -- case in 
          point!grid : guide by which graphic designers can organize, copy and add images 
          in a flexible way while making the concepts easy to absorb and understand.</span>
        <li><span> Rag :: The uneven vertical edge of a block of type -- most commonly the 
          right-hand edge. if the rag is not clean, it can be very distracting to the eye; 
          this can be fixed by reworking the line breaks or by editing a copy.</span>
        <li><span> Widow :: A single word or short line left at the end of a column. This 
          is considered bad typography.</span>
        <li><span> Orphan :: A line exists at the top of the following column! This can be 
          fixed just like the rag, by reworking the line breaks or editing the copy to 
          remove these typography misdeeds.</span>
       </ul>
      </section>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <ul>
       <li><span> printing press :: Used a font based on blackletter, similar ot the font 
         traditionally used with handwritten material. This wasn&#39;t good for printing. 
         Roman type was created to solve this problem. First, Jenson, but the most 
         recognizable roman font is Cambria.</span>
      </ul>
      <section>
       <h3>Italics</h3>
       <p><span>created to save space and money when printing books and long form 
         texts.paved road for old style, transitional style and modern styles of typing.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Caslon</h3>
       <p><span>created &#39;old style&#39; or &#39;Antiqua&#39; of type : old style 
         typefaces have thick serifs, low contrast. these are typically created from 1470 
         to 1600.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Transitional typefaces</h3>
       <p><span>thin serifs with high contrasts between these types. Baskerville is one 
         such font (which was created as an improvement to the caslon typeface!</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Modern style</h3>
       <p><span>very thin serifs with extreme contrast between strokes. created to reject 
         traditional styles, annoyed with typefaces based on handwriting! Modern style 
         initiated by Firmin Didot and Giambatista Bodoni ; Firmin Didot created modern 
         style classification type, Didot, followed by the Bodoni typefaces</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>William Caslon IV</h3>
       <p><span>sans serif typefaces -- no projecting featues at the end of strokes! 
         Helvetica : known as the favorite typeface, one of the most populat. variations 
         on this include slab serifs and gemoetric sans. slab : magazines, newspaper 
         headers; geometric : based on simple geometric shapes.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Susan Kare - great apple designer!</h3>
       <p><span>She did Chicago, a neat pixel sans-serif typeface -- this could be cool 
         to use, as well as Monaco - (kind of boring). Geneva is the third typeface; 
         it&#39;s inspired by helvetica and is a neo-grotesque typeface, a realist 
         typeface including basic ligatures, long s and r rotunda as optionals. bitmap 
         fonts are very cool and I should look into using them! realist ~=grotesquemore 
         reading (TODO):: </span><a class=external

     <section>
      <h2>Embellishments</h2>
      <p><span>indents: indenting</span>
      <p><span>the first line of every paragraph has always been a convention -- to 
        create a visual separation between paragraphsCreative ieaas : extreme indent, 
        outdent. with room and for a cleaner, more open look, separate paragraph s with 
        an extra line rather than using tab indentation at all!arabesques :; graphic 
        ordaments and embellishments -- from simple geometric designs to ornate 
        configurations. many are often digital recreations of historic designs. they 
        have many uses - have fun with them</span>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Classifying Type</h2>
      <section>
       <h3>Serif</h3>
       <p><span>Traditional typefaces with feet or arms hanging off of the end of letter 
         strokes, adding a thick or thin look to the letter. These are considered the 
         easiest fonts to read. Serif fonts are &#39;fancy&#39; fonts -- they all have 
         embellishments. Times New Roman, a serif font, is the most used font as the most 
         common font found in newspapers.</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> Examples :: baskerville, clarendon, garamond, georgia, trajan</span>
       </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Sans-Serif</h3>
       <p><span> Fonts without serifs and having an overall more even stroke weight. 
         clean, modern, minima list</span>
       <p><span> - Examples :: arial, futura, impact, myriad, tahoma</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Decorative</h3>
       <p><span>Fonts typically used only for attention-grabbing headlines. Only one 
         decorative font should be used, and not as the body font!</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Script</h3>
       <p><span>Script fonts are intended to mimic handwriting, so the letters often 
         touch one another. These fonts should never be used with all-caps.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Dingbats</h3>
       <p><span>These fonts contain characters that are small pieces of art, used to 
         enhance the design of the page. Dingbats are usually packaged with a specific 
         font and mimic its style.</span>
      </section>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <section>
       <h3>Font Size</h3>
       <p><span>On computers, 72 pt. font corresponds to one inch on paper. Two different 
         font sizes at the same point can correspond to different physical sizes, and 
         correct size does depend on use.</span>
      </section>
      <section>
       <h3>Spacing</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> character and word spacing, kerning, -- space between each character or 
          letter, adjusted to create pleasing look</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span>tracking, -- adjustment of word spacing, similar to kerning but refers to 
         space between words rather than characters</span>
       <p><span>line spacing, leading -- amount of space between lines of type -- larger 
         the type, the more leading needed!</span>
       <p><span>, paragraph spacing, alignment, -- alignment : text flowing on a page. 
         center, left, right etc. justified : straight edge on boht sides!</span>
       <p><span>line breaks and rag, hyphens, -- don&#39;t have more than two 
         hyphenations in a row, don&#39;t have too many hyphenated lines in a single 
         paragraph, ensure the rag checks out, make sure that justified text looks 
         natural</span>
       <p><span>widows and orphans -- paragraph spacing -- at end: widow; at top of 
         following;</span>
       <p><span>orphan! do not leave these distracting shapes! edit the copy to remove 
         them.</span>
       <p><span>never use bold serif type, apparently? john cane is very against it.</span>
