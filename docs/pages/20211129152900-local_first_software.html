   <h1 class=title-top>Local-First Software</h1>
   <p><span>Local-first software is a software data management strategy and 
     philosophy that stores a user&#39;s functional data on their own device rather 
     than on the company&#39;s servers, ideally in a manner that allows the user to 
     trivially access this data offline or with external programs. Think programs 
     like </span>
    <pre></pre><span> and their ability to allow users to develop software on their 
     own at any time, anywhere, in a decentralize fashion, then sync it with some 
     external source of truth when available.</span>
   <p><span>The research lab </span><a class=external
    href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">[Ink &amp; Switch]</a><span> has in 
     particular been a major proponent of this organizational strategy, though it 
     hasn&#39;t yet infiltrated industry. It&#39;s used in a variety of niche 
     personal knowledge management solutions, such as Roam and Obsidian, but 
     hasn&#39;t yet found a place in the average computer user&#39;s software arsenal 
     yet.</span>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p><span>Much of today&#39;s cloud-based software traps user data in proprietary 
      silos, preventing end users from freely using their data however they&#39;d 
      like.</span>
    <p><span>Generally, it&#39;s good to be able to access data offline or to be able 
      to extract it! This prevents companies from being able to hold data hostage and 
      extract value from something that users have presumably only provided to the 
      company in order to use it themselves.</span>
    <p><span>This also saves users a lot of time. It seems senseless to have to 
      manually input complex, computerized information when switching products or 
      services, but data siloes typically prevent easily-tran.</span>

    <h2>Counterarguments</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>People have internet connections everywhere nowadays. Why should I care about 
      using data offline?</h3>
     <p><span>There are a variety of ways in which internet can be deprived from you. 
       Dependence on the internet for regular tasks is dangerous!</span>
