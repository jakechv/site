    <h2>Status Quo</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
     <p><span>Pros:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Single source of truth: it&#39;s a trustworthy source. People know to 
        get their data from here.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Tons of information. Crowdsourcing has done the</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span>Cons:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Because it&#39;s a single source of truth, there are constant fights 
        over what belongs where that are often fruitless.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> There are also strong arguments that are made for information being 
        &#39;out of scope&#39; for wikipedia and belonging to a page or site that is 
        more domain specific.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> The organization is bloated and inneficient. They really don&#39;t need 
        your donations.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> The servers are centralized and controlled by a single private entity 
        with the potenial to hold data (partially - sans clever parsers) captive.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Wikia</h3>
     <p><span>Pros:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Tons of information with moderators who are experts on their domains.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Dedicated contributors, existing communities, easy to edit.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span>Cons:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Divided into lots of different wikis with no interoperability between 
        them.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Tons of overlap between wikis (i.e. multiple star wars and minecraft 
        ones, among other franchises and tropes)</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Typically used for casual and hobby interests rather than professional 
        writing and work - why?</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Personal wiki implementation</h3>
     <p><span>Pros:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Super flexible.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span>Cons:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Not a consistent or reliable source of information, as it&#39;s 
        typically controlled by one person.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Can be disorganized and things can easily become unmaintained.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Version control managed files</h3>
     <p><span>Pros:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Built-in consensus algorithm.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span>Cons:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Concurrent modification hurts.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Decentralized: share information from many sources without being 
       controlled by any of them</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Open: should incorporate as many sources of knowledge as possible, and 
       individual wikis should have tons of agency.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Easy to use: it should be incredibly easy to contribute to and 
       communicate with some sort of central wiki.</span>
    </ul>
    <section>
     <h3>Information Sources</h3>
     <p><span>In order of priority:</span>
     <p><span>1. Wikia sites (there are tons!)</span>
     <p><span>2. Wikipedia</span>
     <p><span>3. wiki.c2.org</span>
     <p><span>4. Assorted third party wikis.</span>
     <p><span>5. [perhaps] personal wikis</span>
     <p><span>6. etc...</span>
     <p><span>Fusing all of the Wikia sites into a single, cohesive wiki seems 
       incredibly useful.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Feature Ideas</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> shared &amp; enhanced pages :: fuse pages that cover similar or related 
        topics together into one view.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> consensus :: condense and share overlapping information, reducing the 
        amount of duplication.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> interoperable :: shift from one wiki to another easily.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Wiki IR related decentralized wiki idea (what we were talking about in chat, 
     but not really what is above)</h2>
    <p><span> - uses wiki IR standard to link together many peoples personal wikis</span>
    <p><span> - there is an engine at the center (or several?) that crawl the 
      wikiverse and attempt to bring together pages that are similar</span>
    <p><span> - when pages are similar (by AI?, NLP measure), suggest several types of 
      merging</span>
    <p><span> - suggestion ways</span>
    <p><span> - as part of wiki IR cli tool display suggestions</span>
    <p><span> - make tiny website dashbaord backed by small webapp that phones to 
      recomender engine</span>
    <p><span> - types of page merging (between peoples federated wiki)</span>
    <p><span> - link at the bottom of page to other pages with similar content (like 
      webring)</span>
    <p><span> - transclude entire other page to bottom of your page (and vice versa, 
      both pages in the link transclude eachother)</span>
    <p><span> - suggest that pages are merged using git-esque strategy (pull request, 
      text diff/merge tools like mergely)</span>
    <p><span> - q: where does consenus page live? on neither page? (next to ai 
      engines) on one page? (one of the merge requesters &#39;wins&#39;, one 
      conceceds), or both (they share :))</span>
    <p><span> - goals of merging</span>
    <p><span> - reduce information duplication</span>
    <p><span> - instead of conflicts of information being resolved in backchannel of 
      wikipedia, consensus arguments are disputed publicly through pull requests and 
      accepted/rejected page links</span>
    <p><span> - epic and cool</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Conversation linking</h2>
    <p><span> - make conversations first class primitive of wiki, so that concepts are 
      linked to discussion in which they are conceived</span>
    <p><span> - can be as simple as citations linking to specific conversations</span>
    <p><span> - uses matrix? hard part is technical challenge of implementation</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Backlink fixing</h2>
    <p><span> - move/rename pages and update backlinks</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Automatically backup videos/external sites</h2>
    <p><span> - </span><a class=external href=https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup>
      [https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup]</a>
    <p><span> - like gwern, to prevent linkrot</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Provide tools to make good public/private separation</h2>
    <p><span> - so that people can have shareable personal wiki concepts</span><i>
      reference pages, while also having extremely messy private brainstorming 
      (brainstorming=unformed,errorfull,shameless,indulgently bad, creative, risky)</i>
     <span>exobrain wiki pages.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Syntax that is not static/markup</h2>
    <p><span> - I want a markup syntax like (move [otherpage]: &quot; this concept 
      deserves to be in other page, but right now i am in [firstpage] and don&#39;t 
      want to move all the way to otherpage in emacs so im gonna write this thought in 
      a move block: this thought&quot;)</span>
    <p><span> - and that will append that thought to the bottom of other page once i 
      save or run tool or something (linter?)</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Smart todo aggregation system</h2>
    <p><span> - dokuwiki has decent one,</span>
    <p><span> - zimwiki also has some good features (like hiding todo until certain 
      date)</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>New types of syntax</h2>
    <p><span> - some syntax for assigning how sure you are of an idea, or how much you 
      like it</span>
    <p><span> - font size???!</span>
    <p><span> - number of exclamation points vs question marks !!!</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>First class support for sorting lists</h2>
    <p><span> - idk how this would work but interactive sorting is underrated!!!</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Visualizers </h2>
    <p><span> - like roam</span><i>logseq</i><span>etc.</span>
    <p><span> - but if they want to use those interactively, just use them and use 
      wiki IR to convert wiki to them</span>
    <p><span> - maybe support something simple like</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>WIKI LSP</h2>
    <p><span> - breadcrumbs (</span><a class=external
     href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/wu4kP.png)>[https://i.stack.imgur.com/wu4kP.png)]</a>
    <p><span> - definition/lookup. like you can name concepts and hover for 
      definitions?</span>
    <p><span> - autocompletion of other page names</span>
