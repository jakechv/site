    <p><span>The most impressive people care a lot about what others think - anyone - 
      but they only care on a long time horizon, as so long as the history books get 
      it right the work is justified.</span>
    <p><span>Trade short term status for long term; most people are unwilling to do 
      this, but it&#39;s a sactifice worth making to become successful.</span>
    <p><span>As Mike said: pick up the camera, put down social media, and work for 10 
      years. Become an expert. Only then can you come out and show your talent to 
      everyone; you&#39;ll be most successful that wa; you&#39;ll be most successful 
      that way.</span>
