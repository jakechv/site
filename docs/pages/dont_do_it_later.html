    <h2>pressure</h2>
    <p><span>i always feel this insane pressure to work on things later, to do things 
      later, to put things off - because i&#39;ll always be able to do them later.</span>
    <p><span>this just isn&#39;t true. later, i&#39;ll be a different person in a 
      different place in life with a different perspective and mindset. saying no to 
      doing something now has deprived myself of that experience forever! i&#39;ll 
      never be a ble to go back and live the life in which i made the decision to *do* 
      instead of *wait*.</span>
    <p><span>i often spend just as much time thinking about these tasks as i would 
      spend actually doing them... from now on, i will aspire to jump the gun. seize 
      the moment. most of the time </span>

    <h2>unstructure</h2>
    <p><span>it&#39;s important to have a structured way of managing information, but 
      this should by no means intrude on your way of livimg life.</span>
    <p><span>i have no desire to keep a daily planner or calendar, and though i 
      acknowledge it would be cool to track such things the uptight discipline this 
      requires is just not for me. i know spontenaity is not heslthy for the human 
      mind and body but i aspire to live it one day</span>
    <p><span>doing it later is like doing everything all at once</span>
