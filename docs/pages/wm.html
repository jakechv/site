     <p><span>Window managers are programs that allow a user to interface with their 
       computer.</span>
     <p><span>I currently use the Sway window manager for the benefits that Wayland 
       provides, but I&#39;ve used EXWM, </span><a class=internal
      href=file:../tools/bspwm.org>{Bspwm}</a><span>, i3 and herbstluftwm in the past - 
       as well as whatever GNOME system that Ubuntu had installed on 18.</span>
     <p><a class=external href=https://www.are.na/block/18752836>[Sahand Nayebaziz on 
       Twitter â€” Are.na]</a><span>: Very cool keyboard-only manipulation of a design 
       tool. The whole operating system should offer this level of easy, 
       customizability and control over the work. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the overuse 
       of the command palette though...</span>

         created by a terminal on top of the terminal rather than allowing the terminal 
         to waste space. This is a cool idea and makes the system feel smoother - but it 
         might be more interesting to see the output in some way while viewing the result 
         of the command in an ergonomic, notebook-like way! Some terminals with web 
         rendering capabilities are working on these visualizations, but they&#39;ve been 
         done since smalltalk, really.</span>

      <h2>Cool ideas</h2>
      <p><span>I want to be able to have a computing environment that&#39;s both 
        local-first and accessible from anywhere. I don&#39;t always have an internet 
        connection, so I want my information readily available, but on occasion I only 
        have access to an arbitrary device - where the only guarantee I have is that the 
        device has a web browser. My system should work within these constraints!</span>

        <span> is interesting insofar as its behavior is runtime modifiable using Common 
         Lisp. I&#39;m not sure how far this goes or to what degree people want to be 
         able to modify their window manager - it&#39;s not something that strikes me as 
         particularly flexible, but it might be nice to have such a system to work with 
         during development of a WM.</span>

       <ul>
        <li><span> ideas : changing the classname by identification in the bspwm tree!</span>
        <li><span> &#39; sticky&#39; scratchpad : will switch monitors only if the desktop 
          is swapped with the other monitor. personal policy - &#39;scratchbad when opened 
          occupies the biggest window&#39;</span>
        <li><span> sticky normal terminal window (with tmux, via byobu) to the scratchpad 
          is much more useful and allows for a single terminal window to be kept open 
          rather than having to use many</span>

          [http://thedarnedestthing.com/bspwm]</a><span>idea : have window actions focus 
          and place the window on the main window of the target desktop.</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span>a swap monitor action is very cool; may want to either retain or swap 
         monitor focus independent of this! depending on the direction of the hotkey 
         relative to the monitor which has focus.if key action points to opposite 
         monitor, swap the desktop moving the focus with the desktop; else, retain focus 
         on the current monitor while cycling the desktop</span>
       <p><span>toggling the dock! this is much more distraction free (through conky) as 
         opposed to a continuously updating status line at the top or bottom of the 
         screen. conky is super beautiful and configuring it would besuper useful. run 
         conky above the desktop windows via xdotool as per sdothum&#39;s articles</span>
       <p><span>this seems like the most useful and powerful way to go in terms of a 
         system configuration. make sure to use this one in the future.</span>

         [http://thedarnedestthing.com/herbstluftwm%20workflow)]</a>
       <ul>
        <li><span> dynamic window placement to balance frames</span>
        <li><span> dynamic window focus to avoid empty frame focus on application close</span>
        <li><span> distraction free monocle layout proportions (versus fullscreen mode)</span>
        <li><span> automatic desktop layout restore on focus and monitor swap*</span>
        <li><span> quick monitor and frame swapping with focus directions</span>
        <li><span> hide/unhide windows per desktop</span>
        <li><span> pulsating borders to indicate overlapped windows</span>
        <li><span> virtual monitors to show/hide the conky system information panel</span>
        <li><span> single status bar to follow monitor focus and hint monitor geometry 
          width</span>
        <li><span> blur background if a window is present on the desktop</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span>note that monitor geometries are global when set.</span>
       <p><span>honestly his explanation is pretty complicated: there are a lot of things 
         that can be done without this complex configuration.</span>
       <p><span>can have a status bar that follows the monitor focus! killing the status 
         bar isn&#39;t super effective, but using xdotool to manage the visibility of the 
         panels seems muh more palatable</span>

       <h3>XMonad</h3>
       <p><span>cool because it is written in and configured with haskell. this is 
         another manual tiling window manager; you have to manually align and manage 
         tiles.</span>
       <p><span>idea : rather than manually moving the window in between panels, shifting 
         all of the workspaces &#39;one to the right&#39; or &#39;one to the left&#39; to 
         refocus the panel u want at the center seems super valuable! this means that u 
         dont have to reconfigure all of the stuff displayed at any given time)</span>
       <p><span>not sure if this is worthwhile as opposed to other things : bspwm 
         doesn&#39;t do anything other than window management, unlike other programs that 
         may not integrate very well into the existing shell.</span>
       <p><span>benefits:</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> extensive multimonitor support</span>
        <li><span> stable and feature rich</span>
        <li><span> easy to configure and extend</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span>drawbacks:</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> huge</span>
        <li><span> fractured into many different libraries</span>
        <li><span> terrible floating layer that cannot always be avoided</span>
        <li><span> using haskell (though this is also a pro?)</span>
       </ul>
       <p><span>The rEFInd boot menu and it&#39;s super slow as it has to load of the 
         images from BIOS - not a good experience. It&#39;s fine to show logs as your 
         computer starts up.</span>

       <h3>things to integrate</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><span> whatever side manager that sdothum uses in lieu of the header interface</span>
        <li><span> a terminal email client</span>
        <li><span> better notification daemon</span>
        <li><span> unifying chat app? (slack</span><i>signal</i><span>discord/irc(????) 
          frontend somehow)</span>
        <li><span> twitter ? (may not want to browse twitter at all ...)</span>
