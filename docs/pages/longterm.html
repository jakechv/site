    <h2>Do I need to go to university?</h2>
    <p><a class=external href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/">
      [article]</a>
    <p><span>it&#39;s hard to know who should take nontraditional paths, and many 
      people are</span>
    <p><span>looking for validation not to do so. realistically, this is the best 
      option</span>
    <p><span>for most people, both socially and academically.</span>
    <p><span>Some questions:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have things that I deeply want to spend a year of my life 
       exploring</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> and working on?</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have a way to support myself that leaves me time and energy to 
       grow?</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Can I really work self-directed for months at a time? Do I have 
       examples of</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> me working hard on a personal project or learning without external</span>
    <p><span> structure?</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have or can I learn the skills I need to work on this project</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> independently?</span>
    <p><span>independently?</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do I have sources of community, peer support or mentorship for what I 
       want</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> to do?</span>
    <p><span>Those who leave university may be disparaging their efforts to make 
      friends.</span>
    <p><span>However, the ability to focus independently for an extended period of 
      time</span>
    <p><span>before heading to college is ideal for many people to flourish.</span>

    <h2>Tools for Better Thinking</h2>
    <p><a class=external href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23339830">[thread]</a>
    <p><span>The most underrated problem solving tool is to type out and explain your</span>
    <p><span>thought process.</span>
    <p><span>Start writing down questions to ask others; as you explain what you have</span>
    <p><span>tried, you will begin to realize that there are more things left to try 
      --</span>
    <p><span>some of which being potential solutions.</span>
    <p><span>Type your question into StackOverflow to submit; you&#39;ll be fearful of 
      asking</span>
    <p><span>the question.</span>
    <p><span>Rank factors; always express factors as positive attributes. After 
      generating</span>
    <p><span>the table, the longest continuous line of check marks for each factor</span>
    <p><span>determines the choice (though this can be gamed...)</span>
    <p><span>State charts: easy to reason about state changes without the explosion of</span>
    <p><span>state machines. These are hierarchical state machines, in a sense.</span>
    <p><span>The Inversion Methods: The solution to many hard problems can be 
      clarified by</span>
    <p><span>re-expressing them in inverse form.</span>
    <p><span>Crossline: structure your thoughts as you type and make cross-references.</span>

    <h2>Working Effectively</h2>
    <p><a class=external href="https://www.stevestreeting.com/2010/09/04/work-2-0/">
      [article]</a>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Problem: staying &#39;in the zone&#39; is just not healthy or effective 
       for a</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> programmer! However, long periods of concentration are vital for a</span>
    <p><span> programmer to better understand their code and succeed. This crazy</span>
    <p><span> dedication helps develop unhealthy habits and can prevent you from</span>
    <p><span> properly focusing.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Concentration periods are the most important part of programming. 
       Losing</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> concentration means losing all context, and losing all context means 
      that</span>
    <p><span> you&#39;ll spend lots of time reorienting yourself and entering a 
      stronger</span>
    <p><span> period of focus.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> It&#39;s difficult to adjust, and this leads to substantially decreased</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> productivity.</span>
    <p><span>To improve:</span>
    <p><span>1. Embrace interruptions. Learn to accept interruptions and avoid giving 
      up</span>
    <p><span>through them.</span>
    <p><span>2. Maintain context outside of your head at all times. Always explicitly</span>
    <p><span>comment and track what you&#39;re doing, teh decisions you&#39;re making. 
      etc.</span>
    <p><span>Externalizing thoughts can help you clarify them! Every so often, make 
      sure</span>
    <p><span>to record these (the author does this at 30 minute intervals).</span>
    <p><span>3. Ignore tangental issues. Focus on the singular current task and 
      don&#39;t</span>
    <p><span>worry about things that could get you sidetracked! Write those down with 
      a</span>
    <p><span>ticket system that&#39;s fast, lightweight and agnostic to the amount of 
      detail</span>
    <p><span>put into these thoughts. The most important thing to do is to put this 
      idea</span>
    <p><span>away until it can be summoned in a future context.</span>
    <p><span>4. Always know of the one thing you will do next.</span>
    <p><span>5. Prioritize negatively :: assume baseline that you will not do any of 
      the</span>
    <p><span>tasks, then assess the negative outcomes of not doing each one. Perform 
      the</span>
    <p><span>task that will have the most negative outcome first.</span>
    <p><span>6. Recognize the benefits of breaks. Breaks have great benefits, 
      encourage</span>
    <p><span>better health, and can offer a new context from which the problem can be</span>
    <p><span>tackled!</span>

       automating out of work]</a>
     <p><span>The best work is done when you do it for yourself.</span>
     <p><span>you sign your brains away when you go to work for a big company, and 
       these</span>
     <p><span>people will likely be B players -- no matter how many great people they 
       hire.</span>
     <p><span>most A players have more important things to do with their own time. 
       without</span>
     <p><span>ownership, there is a high chance that you will not be at your best.</span>
     <p><span>non-technical business :: sometimes daily tasks do not end up driving</span>
     <p><span>revenue! the others are driving the revenue, you are maintaining thigns 
       for</span>
     <p><span>them. their capacity to define tasks for you may not ever outpace your</span>
     <p><span>ability to deliver.</span>
     <p><span>automating yourself out of a job could be a goal, but this doesn&#39;t 
       work:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> system complexity means something can always break!</span>
