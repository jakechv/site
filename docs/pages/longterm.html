      <h2>Working Effectively</h2>

      <ul>
       <li><span> Problem: staying &#39;in the zone&#39; is just not healthy or effective 
         for a programmer! However, long periods of concentration are vital for a 
         programmer to better understand their code and succeed. This crazy dedication 
         helps develop unhealthy habits and can prevent you from properly focusing.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Concentration periods are the most important part of programming. 
         Losing concentration means losing all context, and losing all context means that 
         you&#39;ll spend lots of time reorienting yourself and entering a stronger 
         period of focus.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> It&#39;s difficult to adjust, and this leads to substantially decreased 
         productivity. To improve:</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span>1. Embrace interruptions. Learn to accept interruptions and avoid giving 
        up through them.</span>
      <p><span>2. Maintain context outside of your head at all times. Always explicitly 
        comment and track what you&#39;re doing, teh decisions you&#39;re making. etc. 
        Externalizing thoughts can help you clarify them! Every so often, make sure to 
        record these (the author does this at 30 minute intervals).</span>
      <p><span>3. Ignore tangental issues. Focus on the singular current task and 
        don&#39;t worry about things that could get you sidetracked! Write those down 
        with a ticket system that&#39;s fast, lightweight and agnostic to the amount of 
        detail put into these thoughts. The most important thing to do is to put this 
        idea away until it can be summoned in a future context.</span>
      <p><span>4. Always know of the one thing you will do next.</span>
      <p><span>5. Prioritize negatively :: assume baseline that you will not do any of 
        the tasks, then assess the negative outcomes of not doing each one. Perform the 
        task that will have the most negative outcome first.</span>
      <p><span>6. Recognize the benefits of breaks. Breaks have great benefits, 
        encourage better health, and can offer a new context from which the problem can 
        be tackled!</span>

         [https://www.perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life]</a>
       <p><span>inversion :: avoiding stupidity is easier and better than being brilliant</span>
       <p><span>doublespeak :: saying the opposite of what one means</span>
       <p><span>theory of constraints :: focus on the bottleneck, the weakest point of 
         the system, always.</span>
       <p><span>preference falsification :: lying to conform to the most socially 
         acceptable opinion at the time</span>
       <p><span>mimetic teory of desire: rather than having our own desires, we imitate 
         the desires of others and pursue their ideas</span>
       <p><span>mimetic theory of conflict :: similar = fight left off on 10!</span>
       <p><a class=external href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18120322">[on 
         automating out of work]</a>
       <p><span>The best work is done when you do it for yourself.</span>
       <p><span>you sign your brains away when you go to work for a big company, and 
         these people will likely be B players -- no matter how many great people they 
         hire.</span>
       <p><span>most A players have more important things to do with their own time. 
         without ownership, there is a high chance that you will not be at your best.</span>
       <p><span>non-technical business :: sometimes daily tasks do not end up driving 
         revenue! the others are driving the revenue, you are maintaining thigns for 
         them. their capacity to define tasks for you may not ever outpace your ability 
         to deliver.</span>
       <p><span>automating yourself out of a job could be a goal, but this doesn&#39;t 
         work:</span>
       <ul>
        <li><span> system complexity means something can always break!</span>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li><span> markets rapidly evolve and parts cease to work in the future!</span>
       </ul>

        <li><span> automation and the 15 hour work week from keynes</span>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li><span> though automation continues, humans find ourselves working longer and 
          longer hours -- even though we enjoy benefits from those who use automation and 
          those who owned automated products.</span>
