Racket, Clojure and other lisps are slow relative toCommon Lisp. I don't have time for a slow programming language builton some hill of abstractions when high level languages that are alsoincredibly fast exist.</li><li>Fast to use.

A function definition conveys some statement in naturallanguage - it's a phrase that can parse some argument(s) providedanywhere in the phrase - and allows users to write in more clearEnglish. It's a fun idea, but I doubt that this system preserves itsreadability when working with complex programs; I'd bet that itapproaches the complexity of a large, mathematical proof and takes onthe structure of a programming language but far more verbose and a bitmore difficult to reason about (Assume we have some variable that meetsthis constraint; set it here, reset it here, apply this functioncomposition here, and so forth). It's possible that there is some way toescape this - but I've only spent five minutes reading this thing.</p><p><a href="https://flix.dev/#/blog/naming-functional-and-destructive-operations/">Flix \| The Flix Programming Language</a><br />Cooooooool</p><h2 id="dsls">DSLs</h2><p><a href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/verifisc/mlang">MLang</a><br />A DSL created to represent and calculate the French tax code.</p><ul><li><a href="http://bloom-lang.net/bud/">Bloom</a></li><li><a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> :: langauge for system configuration</li><li><a href="https://microformats.io/">https://microformats.io/</a> html dsl in classes to add meaning</li><li><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">puzzlescript</a> :: language for puzzles!</li><li><a href="http://frinklang.org/">Frink</a> :: <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/frink?utm_source=hillelwayne&amp;amp;utm_medium=email">The Frink is Good, the Unit isEvil</a>.Language that's optimized for unit conversions and usability; if Ihave to do a lot of unit manipulation and I'm worried about forgettinganything, I can offset the burden to Frink and mostly use it like asuper elegant calculator.
