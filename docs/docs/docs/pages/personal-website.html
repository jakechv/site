     <h1 class=title-top>Personal Websites</h1>
     <p><span>I love the personal website; it says so much about who someone is, what 
       they stand for, and how they&#39;d like to represent themselves - from both a 
       technical and an aesthetic perspective. One of my favorite pastimes is browsing 
       these sites and trying to learn more about the people behind them.</span>

          that involves placing blocks in various places, build with a combination of hugo 
          and node. uses twien.js to show some great animations working!</span>

          a website like this to showcase my own projects via the github api! See </span>

          playable inside a game boy! This is a major motivation for me to work on this 
          wiki platform -- I want a single source of truth for all of my web spaces, but I 
          also want to be able to render different representations of my website depending 
          on how I&#39;d like to display it at any given time. The question is, though, 
          how I should best separate these concerns!</span>
