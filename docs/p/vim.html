   <h1>Vim</h1>
   <p><span>Vim is a text editor with an easily configurable extension language. 
     It&#39;s most frequently used as a </span><span> program but also has an 
     (aft-used) graphical application distribution (Gvim).</span>
   <p><span>I&#39;ve come to prefer the power of </span><span> but I do miss 
     Vim&#39;s performance.</span>
   <p><span>However, it has a first-class editor-based extension language that&#39;s 
     written to prioritize text processing and configuration. Its extensive, literate 
     keybindings that have made their way into every popular text editor as well as 
     many other applications.</span>
   <p><span>It&#39;s one of best text-editing tools in the Unix ecosystem, and Vim 
     users often have a library of cli and tui programs that they use in conjunction 
     with Vim to facilitate a desktop ecosystem without a GUI.</span>
   <p><span>Vim is often preinstalled on Unix systems. If it&#39;s unavailable, such 
     systems will likely still have vi (or busybox vi), so taking the time to learn 
     vim keybindings is worthwhile for their flexibility throughout programming 
     environments.</span>

    <h2>Shortcut Optimisations</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>Leader keys</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Comma :: As it should always be followed with a space grammatically, 
        every other key can be freely mapped to with no delay! You lose the 
        functionality of backwards repeating though...</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Space :: What doom emacs uses, my current key and what I&#39;m used to. 
        This works fine, but the timeout definitely can impact the fluency of writing on 
        occasion.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Semicolon :: Interesting option, but there seem to be some strange 
        repeat patterns in specific modes.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> \ :: Controversial, it&#39;s pretty far away... but it&#39;s the 
        default. Unclear whether bashing the pinkie to the right is a great motion (just 
        like Emacs and the left).</span>

    <h2>Lua plugins and config</h2>
    <p><span>I don&#39;t think lua is ready for NixOS yet - it seems to have some 
      trouble finding plugins for the Lua path - but it&#39;s worth considering for 
      the future.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> feline.nvim :: A good status line for NeoVim with Lua, much faster than 
       status quo.</span>
