  <h1>Vim</h1>
  <p><span>Vim is a text editor with an easily configurable extension language. 
    It&#39;s most frequently used as a </span><a
   href=id:a5517310-76a5-4663-9ca3-34a56d7315e1>TUI</a><span> program but also has 
    an (aft-used) graphical application distribution (Gvim).</span>
  <p><span>I&#39;ve come to prefer the power of </span><a
   href=id:62a9456a-e08a-4dc4-8e9d-310deffdb720>Emacs</a><span> but I do miss 
    Vim&#39;s performance.</span>
  <p><span>However, it has a first-class editor-based extension language that&#39;s 
    written to prioritize text processing and configuration. Its extensive, literate 
    keybindings that have made their way into every popular text editor as well as 
    many other applications.</span>
  <p><span>It&#39;s one of best text-editing tools in the Unix ecosystem, and Vim 
    users often have a library of cli and tui programs that they use in conjunction 
    with Vim to facilitate a desktop ecosystem without a GUI.</span>
  <p><span>Vim is often preinstalled on Unix systems. If it&#39;s unavailable, such 
    systems will likely still have vi (or busybox vi), so taking the time to learn 
    vim keybindings is worthwhile for their flexibility throughout programming 
    environments.</span>

   <h2>Shortcut Optimisations</h2>
   <section>
    <h3>Leader keys</h3>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Comma :: As it should always be followed with a space grammatically, 
       every other key can be freely mapped to with no delay! You lose the 
       functionality of backwards repeating though...</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Space :: What doom emacs uses, my current key and what I&#39;m used to. 
       This works fine, but the timeout definitely can impact the fluency of writing on 
       occasion.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Semicolon :: Interesting option, but there seem to be some strange 
       repeat patterns in specific modes.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> \ :: Controversial, it&#39;s pretty far away... but it&#39;s the 
       default. Unclear whether bashing the pinkie to the right is a great motion (just 
       like Emacs and the left).</span>
    </ul>

   <h2>Lua plugins and config</h2>
   <p><span>I don&#39;t think lua is ready for NixOS yet - it seems to have some 
     trouble finding plugins for the Lua path - but it&#39;s worth considering for 
     the future.</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> feline.nvim :: A good status line for NeoVim with Lua, much faster than 
      status quo.</span>
