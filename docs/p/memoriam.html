  <h1>Memoriam</h1>
  <p><span>I want to replicate the feeling of memory.</span>
  <section>
   <h2>Rationale</h2>
   <p><span>Memories are temporary.</span>
   <p><span>Memories fade.</span>
   <p><span>Today, we&#39;re empowered with several tools to prevent this. We have 
     devices that constantly track our locations and monitor our activity. I want to 
     use these tools to allow us to travel through our past.</span>
   <p><span>I want to replicate the feeling of walking down a familiar road and 
     seeing a place we have a particularly fond memory of, but in the digital world. 
     Moreover, I want to be able to share this experience with others who may not 
     have lived the same life experiences I have had, and to be able to link across 
     experiences between people.</span>
   <p><span>Further, I&#39;d like to add a nostalgic aspect that we do not often feel 
     in the real world -- one spent on the internet.</span>
   <p><span>(This isn&#39;t a very good name... it should be catchier.) </span>

   <h2>Information</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Location</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Location stamped photos/videos</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Notes on photos</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Textual links for every point</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>Not everything has to be linked to a location, but most browsing is 
     location-based.</span>

   <h2>Rough Idea</h2>
   <section>
    <h3>Temporal View</h3>
    <p><span>Cutscenes happen like a video game with fast travel. Pressing 
      &#39;play&#39; on a day starts with a map and a first location. It will zoom in 
      when digital activ</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>Spacial View</h3>
    <p><span>Visit location -&gt; see everything visible in that location. A lot of 
      this is already handled by Google Maps. You should be able to enter the other 
      views from here so that viewing a location can trigger a memory.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>Textual View</h3>
    <p><span>This is a traditional dictionary view.</span>
    <p><span>It puts text notes first and allows for the browsing of linked 
      information, much like other dictionaries.</span>
    <p><span>I&#39;d like a view that operates similar to my wiki.</span>
