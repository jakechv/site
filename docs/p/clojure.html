  <h1>Clojure</h1>
  <p><span>Clojure is a fascinating Java-based lisp ecosystem. It&#39;s well 
    supported on several platforms thanks to Clojurescript and is probably the best 
    Lisp for production today! I&#39;ve been using it extensively - it&#39;s my 
    favorits browser-based programming language.</span>

    <h3>Fulcro</h3>
    <p><span>Passing functions between front-end and backend is cool, so is convenient 
      integration with many of the databases - but treating the site as a monolithic 
      interface from which data can be queried feels so different from React&#39;s 
      mindset of avoiding global state and exposing the minimum amount of data 
      necessary for the system to function as a whole.</span>
    <p><span>I really like the shadow-cljs approach and think NodeJS is more fun than 
      working with Java on the backend (despite whatever potential performance caveats 
      may come from that) but it&#39;s unclear whether the monolithic query approach - 
      one that partially but doesn&#39;t completely obfuscate the network connection - 
      is net beneficial or just confusing for the end user.</span>

    <h3>Reagent</h3>
    <p><span>This is much easier to use than Rum, but has caveats: it doesn&#39;t have 
      any mixins and uses its own implementation of atoms rather than falling back to 
      React&#39;s lifecycle</span><span></span>
