    <h2>ConLangs</h2>
    <p><span>Definition is subject to discussion - an initial conlang that is later 
      developed by a native population may or may not be one. Simplified Chinese is 
      not one.</span>

     <h3>Lojban</h3>
     <p><span>A logical language with no grammatical ambiguity.</span>
     <p>
     <p><span> Seems to have a lot of overlap with those interested in type theory, but 
       in general the context is valuable to many languages, and by speaking lojban you 
       are empowering yourself to communicate with others who also chose to learn 
       Lojban.</span>
     <p><span>: A good read on lojban, English and communicative precision.</span>
