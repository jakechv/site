   <p><span>Definition is subject to discussion - an initial conlang that is later 
     developed by a native population may or may not be one. Simplified Chinese is

      Why do so few people speak lojban?</a><span> Seems to have a lot of overlap with 
      those interested in type theory, but in general the context is valuable to many 
      languages, and by speaking lojban you are empowering yourself to communicate 
      with others who also chose to learn Lojban.</span>
