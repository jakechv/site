    <p><span> ideas : changing the classname by identification in the bspwm tree!</span>
    <p><span> &#39; sticky&#39; scratchpad : will switch monitors only if the desktop 
      is swapped with the other monitor.</span>
    <p><span> personal policy - &#39;scratchbad when opened occupies the biggest 
      window&#39;</span>
    <p><span> sticky normal terminal window (with tmux, via byobu) to the scratchpad 
      is much more useful and allows for a single terminal window to be kept open 
      rather than having to use many</span>
    <p><span> ui workflow : window actions focus and place the window in the main 
      window on</span>
    <p><span> the target desktop</span>

    <p><span> read on this!</span>
    <p><span> http:</span><span>thedarnedestthing.com</span><span>bspwm</span>
    <p><span> idea : have window actions focus and place the window on the main window 
      of the</span>
    <p><span> target desktop.</span>
    <p><span> a swap monitor action is very cool; may want to either retain or swap 
      monitor</span>
    <p><span> focus independent of this! depending on the direction of the hotkey 
      relative to</span>
    <p><span> the monitor which has focus.if key action points to opposite monitor, 
      swap the</span>
    <p><span> desktop moving the focus with the desktop; else, retain focus on the 
      current</span>
    <p><span> monitor while cycling the desktop</span>
    <p><span> toggling the dock! this is much more distraction free (through conky) as 
      opposed</span>
    <p><span> to a continuously updating status line at the top or bottom of the 
      screen. conky</span>
    <p><span> is super beautiful and configuring it would besuper useful. run conky 
      above the</span>
    <p><span> desktop windows via xdotool as per sdothum&#39;s articles</span>

     <span>comments</span><span>1jubyi</span><span>
      arch_bspwm_never_going_back_to_xmonad</span>
    <p><span>this seems like the most useful and powerful way to go in terms of a 
      system</span>
    <p><span>configuration. make sure to use this one in the future.</span>

    <p><span>things it can do: (see sdothum here: http:</span><span>

    <ul>
     <li><span> dynamic window placement to balance frames</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> dynamic window focus to avoid empty frame focus on application close</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> distraction free monocle layout proportions (versus fullscreen mode)</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> automatic desktop layout restore on focus and monitor swap*</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> quick monitor and frame swapping with focus directions</span>

    <ul>
     <li><span> hide</span><span>unhide windows per desktop</span>

     <li><span> single status bar to follow monitor focus and hint monitor geometry 
       width</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> blur background if a window is present on the desktop</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span>note that monitor geometries are global when set.</span>
    <p><span>honestly his explanation is pretty complicated: there are a lot of things 
      that can be done without this complex configuration</span>
    <p><span>can have a status bar that follows the monitor focus! killing the status 
      bar isn&#39;t super effective, but using xdotool to manage the visibility of the 
      panels seems muh more palatable</span>

    <h2>XMonad</h2>
    <p><span>cool because it is written in and configured with haskell</span>
    <p><span>from my rough understanding, this is another manual tiling window manager 
      (not automatic like bspwm)</span>
    <p><span>idea : rather than manually moving the window in between panels, shifting 
      all of the workspaces &#39;one to the right&#39; or &#39;one to the left&#39; to 
      refocus the panel u want at the center seems super valuable! this means that u 
      dont have to reconfigure all of the stuff displayed at any given time)</span>
    <p><span>not sure if this is worthwhile as opposed to other things : bspwm 
      doesn&#39;t do</span>
    <p><span>anythign other than window management, unlike other programs that may not</span>
    <p><span>integrate very well into the existing shell.</span>
    <p><span>benefits:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> extensive multimonitor support</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> stable and feature rich</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> easy to configure and extend</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span>drawbacks:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> huge</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> fractured into many different libraries</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> terrible floating layer that cannot always be avoided</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> using haskell (though this is also a pro!!)</span>
