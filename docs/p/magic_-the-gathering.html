  <h1>Magic: The Gathering</h1>
  <p><span>I&#39;ve been playing magic the gathering on and off for about ten years. 
    my relationship with the game has changed -- starting as something that 
    resembles a board game, my understanding of the game adapted and i became a 
    collector, then a competitor, then a collector again.</span>
  <p><span>With recent administrative decisions leading to both mass bans and 
    unhealthy card liquidation, I&#39;ll no longer be playing or investing in the 
    game. It&#39;s unhealthy to dedicate time to something so inherently capitalist.</span>
