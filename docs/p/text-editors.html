   <h1>Text Editors</h1>
   <p><span>Text editors control the way you interface with written content. For 
     programmers, this is the vast majority of the content they create, develop, and 
     perhaps consume.</span>

     <li><span> </span><span> :: is a flexible editor with a modular approach to 
       construction; if you implement Xi&#39;s protocol, you can use any user interface 
       that calls back to Xi on the backend. However, it&#39;s plagued with latency 
       issues.</span>

     <h3>live programming editor research</h3>
     <p><span>Excited to present our paper on &quot;Example-Based Live Programming for 
       Everyone&quot; at Onward!</span><span>@splashcon! Together with our @HPI_DE 
       students, we explored how language-agnostic tools for #LiveProgramming can be 
       built with the #LSP and @GraalVM. ðŸ› ðŸš€</span>

     <h3>General Idea</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> build to be language agnostic: use a plugin system to support other 
        programs out of the box</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Abandon the file structure: we can do much more faster if we abandon 
        files and use semantic structures relevant to the programming languages. 
        We&#39;re building a data manipulation framework, and the plugins define the 
        constraints for manipulating the data</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> improve traversal and visualization of these data structures</span>
     </ul>
