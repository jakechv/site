  <h1>Text Editors</h1>
  <p><span>Text editors control the way you interface with written content. For 
    programmers, this is the vast majority of the content they create, develop, and 
    perhaps consume.</span>

      is a flexible editor with a modular approach to construction; if you implement 
      Xi&#39;s protocol, you can use any user interface that calls back to Xi on the 
      backend. However, it&#39;s plagued with latency issues.</span>

    <h3>live programming editor research</h3>
    <p><span>Excited to present our paper on &quot;Example-Based Live Programming for 
      Everyone&quot; at Onward!/@splashcon! Together with our @HPI_DE students, we 
      explored how language-agnostic tools for #LiveProgramming can be built with the 
      #LSP and @GraalVM. ðŸ› ðŸš€</span>

    <h3>General Idea</h3>
    <ul>
     <li><span> build to be language agnostic: use a plugin system to support other 
       programs out of the box</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Abandon the file structure: we can do much more faster if we abandon 
       files and use semantic structures relevant to the programming languages. 
       We&#39;re building a data manipulation framework, and the plugins define the 
       constraints for manipulating the data</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> improve traversal and visualization of these data structures</span>
    </ul>
