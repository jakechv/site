        vehicle&quot;</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> start blogging now and keep blogging. it&#39;s the best way to interact

     <h3>meeting people</h3>
     <p>
     <ul>
      <li><span> create a mental model of yourself to become easy for anyone to meet</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> if you have this projection, if you know how to market yourself, you 
        know how to best network with others</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> fuzzy projections are okay but they&#39;re harder to pinpoint.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> form this projection (about three pieces of information you&#39;d like 
        someone else to hold about you) - and market towards it.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> tell stories -- strong stories. narrow down your own story and use it 
        in conversations with others. tell it on social media. repeat it at length.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> know your ask: the most impactful thing they can do to help you. this 
        can be a local or a global goal; how can you best help other people? this makes 
        it easiest for them to help you, gives them an action to reach back to you 
        about, and keeps them from having to ask lots of clarifying questions. reduce 
        the friction between you and them in terms of getting things done as soon as 
        possible.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> pre meeting motions: scheduling, give as much information as possible, 
        and be specific and accurate. refer back to the article all the time. do 
        background information all of the time.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>

     <h3>concrete examples</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> write: invite people to write you.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> reach out when you see someone you think it woul be interesting to meet</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> ask people for intros and suggestions for people you should meet. do 
        you know anyone i should meet and can you introduce me to them? do this asap. if 
        you know a mutual, ask them for an introduction!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>

    <h2>It is your responsibility to follow up</h2>
    <p><span>https:</span><span>guzey.com</span><span>follow-up</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> follow up at max three times. follow up on a regular schedule. 
       don&#39;t assume they will respond and keep the email around to remind others.</span>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideas not mattering is silly</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> ideas may be cheap but there is never a guarantee of this. defeat your 
       ideas. if they are not defeated, pursue them.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> good ideas are so obvious in retrospect, and they are only obvious in 
       the moment if they do not have holes</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> zero sum concepts are not worth it. ideas not mattering is just a 
       marketing technique to assemble corporations</span>
