   <h1>Terminal UI</h1>
   <p><span>A Terminal UI, or TUI, is a user interface that can be manipulated in the 
     terminal, but that is not interacted with via shell commands.</span>
   <p><span>Programs with a Terminal UI are written to function without the use of a 
     graphical user interface, enabling easy access to desktop environments with 
     tools such as SSH.</span>
   <p><span>Some choose to use their system in an entirely TUI-based fashion with 
     programs such as vim, mutt and tmux. Unfortunately, many websites and web-based 
     programs are not usable without a graphical user interface,</span>
