    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p><span>1. host local servers, one tracking each service</span>
    <p><span>2. connect to these servers with a locally hosted mastodon client</span>
    <p><span>3. each server takes account information and mocks external accounts:</span>
    <p><span> - logs in through social media api</span>
    <p><span> - view posts, corresponding threads</span><span>comments sections</span>
    <p><span> - server publishes data form these services in real time to mastodon</span>
    <p><span> - server creates</span><span>tracks fake mastodon user from every other 
      user</span>
    <p><span> - these users are visible with clever naming scheme and tolerated by</span>
    <p><span> server</span>
    <p><span> - interacting with these real servers from ur acct (must be hosted in 
      same</span>
    <p><span> place) == ur account on that social media interacting with their real</span>
    <p><span> acct</span>
    <p><span> - likes, follows etc. also emulated -- though have to check if current</span>
    <p><span> user is following them, has liked, has followed etc.</span>
    <p><span> - should port over images, videos, gifs etc from whatever proprietary</span>
    <p><span> twitter thing they use to sane default formats to display on mastodon</span>
    <p><span> (i guess these should be cached for some time period, then...)</span>

    <p>
    <p><span>want to avoid static ip, ideally</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> run on home server, always-on computer kind of deal ie beaglebone</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> NAT TOR? Zooko&#39;s triangle -- choosing between human readable, 
       decentralized and unique is impossible. PetNames proposal may be useful</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> key upgrade, but all that is needed is tor .onion address support, 
       truly</span>
