  <h1>Reasons Not To Use</h1>
  <p><span>Reasons not to use popular products and services, just like on RMS&#39;s 
    website</span>
  <section>
   <h2>Adobe</h2>
   <p><span>uses the &quot;software as a service&quot; pattern which gives it 
     complete control over who is allowed to use their software, and it can be 
     revoked at any time, such as when a [government requires 
     it](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20904030/adobe-venezuela-photoshop-behance-us-sanctions).
      With this licensing model, you never own what you&#39;re paying for, you&#39;re 
     just renting it.</span>

   <h2>AT&amp;T</h2>
   <p><span>marketed &quot;unlimited&quot; data plans that were nonetheless throttled 
     after reaching a certain threshold, for which they were rightfully [punished and 
     ordered to refund $60 
     million](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/att-users-whose-unlimited-data-was-throttled-get-60-million-in-refunds/).
      Right after that, they [forced customers to switch to more expensive data plans 
     without asking 
     them](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/att-adds-10-to-smartphone-bills-for-customers-with-older-plans/),
      presumably to make up for this loss. Broadband connections in USA are in 
     general expensive and poor quality, as a result of local monopolies and lack of 
     choices for consumers.</span>

   <h2>Blizzard</h2>
   <p><span></span><a href=\"https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23179289/\">banned 
     a player from a major tournament</a><span> for offending the sensibilities of 
     the Communist Party of China by </span><a
    href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/blitzchung-removed-from-hearthstone-grandmasters-for-liberate-hong-kong-comments/\">
     supporting the Hong Kong protests publicly</a><span>. Blizzard is partially 
     owned by Tencent, which in turn is owned by the Chinese government. History 
     shows that it is exceedingly easy to offend the Chinese government with Winnie 
     the Pooh memes and other nonsense - we should not let oppressive governments 
     dictate what we are allowed to express, especially abroad.</span>

   <h2>Google</h2>
   <p><span>&#39;s &#39;&quot;Project Nightingale&quot; </span><a
    href=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50388464>included buying sensitive 
     health-related records</a><span> about Americans who were not even notified 
     about their data being up for sale or having been sold. Google promises that 
     this data will not be combined with existing consumer data (presumably for 
     targeting ads), but it surely will, and it will not be the first time Google has 
     bought sensitive private data from another company.</span>

    <li><span> </span><a
     href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/10/skype-audio-graded-by-workers-in-china-with-no-security-measures>
      recorded private Skype conversations and Cortana commands and shared them with 
      contractors without making any effort toward anonymizing them</a><span>, or 
      asking the users for permission to record them. Security around these recordings 
      was nonexistent. If you care about privacy, never use any programs that send 
      your voice through third party servers, in particular Microsoft&#39;s.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> uses deliberately confusing UI patterns to </span><a
     href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/442609/confirmed-windows-10-setup-now-prevents-local-account-creation/\">
      force Windows users to create online accounts, instead of local ones during 
      system installation</a><span>. Making local accounts is only possible if you 
      disconnect the computer from the Internet, but </span><a
     href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-wants-to-do-away-with-windows-10-local-accounts/\">
      there are reasons to believe they will eventually force users to always use 
      online Microsoft accounts</a><span> for greater insight into their activities.</span>

   <h2>Samsung</h2>
   <p><span>was caught </span><a
    href=\"rigging smartphone benchmarks, and reporting higher performance.\">
     https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/02/samsung-galaxy-s4-class-action-lawsuit/</a>
    <span> The court ordered them to pay $10 per person, which is insultingly low.</span>

   <h2>Tesla</h2>
   <p><span>can </span><a
    href=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127243/tesla-model-s-autopilot-disabled-remotely-used-car-update>
     remotely disable many features of their cars after they&#39;re sold</a><span>. 
     This is reason enough to never buy them, as they can lose all value at the drop 
     of a hat for any reason.</span>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>Spotify</h2>
   <p><span>They convert individual artists and podcasts into major labels, then take 
     completely control of the artist&#39;s content distribution system. The artist 
     is disposable to them, the product they sell is the playlist</span>

   <h2>Hacker News</h2>
   <p><span></span><a href=\"http://n-gate.com/\">oh my God</a><span></span>
   <p><span>full of investment bros; I don&#39;t think I need to elaborate on the 
     flaws and arrogance of venture capital</span>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>Facebook</h2>
   <p><span>Propaganda, breeding social feedback loops, massive data collection, Zuck 
     laughing at people who &#39;just trust him&#39; with their data. Instagram, 
     Facebook, etc. WhatsApp is less bad, but is inherently supportive of this 
     ecosystem - and we have no idea whether messages are securely encrypted because 
     they will never open-source the product. </span>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>Discord</h2>
   <p><span>Substantial Chinese funding (meaning the PRC has access to decisions and 
     content via board seats), no encryption, privacy policy allows them to collect 
     any data they&#39;d like. </span>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>Spotify</h2>
   <p><span>They actively support DRM, a cause with good intentions (artists should 
     own their work) but terrible impact (people no longer own parts of their 
     computers).</span>
   <p><span>Spotify feigns egalitarianism by pretending to support independent 
     musicians, propping them up in spite of major labels, but in reality these major 
     labels leverage their distribution networks just as effectively internal to 
     Spotify</span>
   <p><span>Spotify&#39;s unique value ad is their set of carefully curated playlists 
     and recommendations - systems designed to promote Spotify and disposable singles 
     rather than artists, careers and concerts. </span>
   <p><span>Their effort to incorporate podcasts into their platform seeks to 
     assimilate podcasts into major labels or distribution networks, preventing them 
     from using any other channels and forcing fans to pay for their distribution 
     networks</span>
   <p><span>We need distribution channels that are artist-first</span>
