   <h1>Reasons Not To Use</h1>
   <p><span>Reasons not to use popular products and services, just like on RMS&#39;s 
     website</span>
   <section>
    <h2>Adobe</h2>
    <p><span>uses the &quot;software as a service&quot; pattern which gives it 
      complete control over who is allowed to use their software, and it can be 
      revoked at any time, such as when a [government requires it](</span><span>With 
      this licensing model, you never own what you&#39;re paying for, you&#39;re just 
      renting it.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>AT&amp;T</h2>
    <p><span>marketed &quot;unlimited&quot; data plans that were nonetheless throttled 
      after reaching a certain threshold, for which they were rightfully [punished and 
      ordered to refund </span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Blizzard</h2>
    <p><span> for offending the sensibilities of the Communist Party of China by </span>
     <span>. Blizzard is partially owned by Tencent, which in turn is owned by the 
      Chinese government. History shows that it is exceedingly easy to offend the 
      Chinese government with Winnie the Pooh memes and other nonsense - we should not 
      let oppressive governments dictate what we are allowed to express, especially 
      abroad.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Google</h2>
    <p><span>&#39;s &#39;&quot;Project Nightingale&quot; </span><span> about Americans 
      who were not even notified about their data being up for sale or having been 
      sold. Google promises that this data will not be combined with existing consumer 
      data (presumably for targeting ads), but it surely will, and it will not be the 
      first time Google has bought sensitive private data from another company.</span>

    <h2>Microsoft</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> uses confusing UI patterns to </span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span>, or asking the users for permission to record them. 
       Security around these recordings was nonexistent. If you care about privacy, 
       never use any programs that send your voice through third party servers, in 
       particular Microsoft&#39;s.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> uses deliberately confusing UI patterns to </span><span>. Making local 
       accounts is only possible if you disconnect the computer from the Internet, but </span>
      <span> for greater insight into their activities.</span>

    <h2>Samsung</h2>
    <p><span>was caught </span><span> The court ordered them to pay </span>

    <h2>Tesla</h2>
    <p><span>can </span><span>. This is reason enough to never buy them, as they can 
      lose all value at the drop of a hat for any reason.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Spotify</h2>
    <p><span>They convert individual artists and podcasts into major labels, then take 
      completely control of the artist&#39;s content distribution system. The artist 
      is disposable to them, the product they sell is the playlist</span>

    <h2>Hacker News</h2>
    <p>
    <p><span>full of investment bros; I don&#39;t think I need to elaborate on the 
      flaws and arrogance of venture capital</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Facebook</h2>
    <p><span>Propaganda, breeding social feedback loops, massive data collection, Zuck 
      laughing at people who &#39;just trust him&#39; with their data. Instagram, 
      Facebook, etc. WhatsApp is less bad, but is inherently supportive of this 
      ecosystem - and we have no idea whether messages are securely encrypted because 
      they will never open-source the product. </span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Discord</h2>
    <p><span>Substantial Chinese funding (meaning the PRC has access to decisions and 
      content via board seats), no encryption, privacy policy allows them to collect 
      any data they&#39;d like. </span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Spotify</h2>
    <p><span>They actively support DRM, a cause with good intentions (artists should 
      own their work) but terrible impact (people no longer own parts of their 
      computers).</span>
    <p><span>Spotify feigns egalitarianism by pretending to support independent 
      musicians, propping them up in spite of major labels, but in reality these major 
      labels leverage their distribution networks just as effectively internal to 
      Spotify</span>
    <p><span>Spotify&#39;s unique value ad is their set of carefully curated playlists 
      and recommendations - systems designed to promote Spotify and disposable singles 
      rather than artists, careers and concerts. </span>
    <p><span>Their effort to incorporate podcasts into their platform seeks to 
      assimilate podcasts into major labels or distribution networks, preventing them 
      from using any other channels and forcing fans to pay for their distribution 
      networks</span>
    <p><span>We need distribution channels that are artist-first</span>
