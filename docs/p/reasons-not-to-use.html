     complete control over who is allowed to use their software, and it can be 
     revoked at any time, such as when a [government requires it](</span><a

     owned by Tencent, which in turn is owned by the Chinese government. History 
     shows that it is exceedingly easy to offend the Chinese government with Winnie 
     the Pooh memes and other nonsense - we should not let oppressive governments 
     dictate what we are allowed to express, especially abroad.</span>

     about their data being up for sale or having been sold. Google promises that 
     this data will not be combined with existing consumer data (presumably for 
     targeting ads), but it surely will, and it will not be the first time Google has 
     bought sensitive private data from another company.</span>

   <p><span>They convert individual artists and podcasts into major labels, then take

   <h2>Facebook</h2>
   <p><span>Propaganda, breeding social feedback loops, massive data collection, Zuck 
     laughing at people who &#39;just trust him&#39; with their data. Instagram, 
     Facebook, etc. WhatsApp is less bad, but is inherently supportive of this 
     ecosystem - and we have no idea whether messages are securely encrypted because 
     they will never open-source the product. </span>

     content via board seats), no encryption, privacy policy allows them to collect

   <h2>Spotify</h2>
   <p><span>They actively support DRM, a cause with good intentions (artists should 
     own their work) but terrible impact (people no longer own parts of their 
     computers).</span>
   <p><span>Spotify feigns egalitarianism by pretending to support independent 
     musicians, propping them up in spite of major labels, but in reality these major 
     labels leverage their distribution networks just as effectively internal to 
     Spotify</span>
   <p><span>Spotify&#39;s unique value ad is their set of carefully curated playlists 
     and recommendations - systems designed to promote Spotify and disposable singles 
     rather than artists, careers and concerts. </span>
   <p><span>Their effort to incorporate podcasts into their platform seeks to 
     assimilate podcasts into major labels or distribution networks, preventing them 
     from using any other channels and forcing fans to pay for their distribution 
     networks</span>
   <p><span>We need distribution channels that are artist-first</span>
