   <h1>Gemini</h1>
   <p><span>HTTP is a bloated protocol.</span>
   <p><span>Any visit to the website of a large company will tell you this.</span>
   <p><span>Significant sizes of applications (often over 5 megabytes!), load times, 
     and the constant</span>
   <p><span>reminder to consent to cookies are all emblematic of what our internet 
     has</span>
   <p><span>become -- a service hostile to its users for the sake of profit.</span>
   <p><span>Practically every website you visit tracks your information to collect 
     both analytics and</span>
   <p><span>personal data, assembling a profile of you that can be sold to 
     advertisers,</span>
   <p><span>government agencies and whoever else wants a cut of your data.</span>
   <p><span>Gemini is a new protocol for browsing the internet founded by solderpunk.</span>
   <p><span>it&#39;s designed only to serve data, and intends to foster a friendlier 
     internet</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span>- one in which arbitrary information can&#39;t be passed from consumer 
      to producer no</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>matter what the motivation.</span>
   <p><span>Gemini can be thought of as the HTTPS equivalent of Gopher: all traffic 
     is secured and encrypted.</span>
   <p><span>I hope to have this wiki, along with my other personal websites, up on 
     Gemini soon. All it takes is a program to convert org-mode files to files in a 
     Gemini framework rather than a Hugo blog.</span>
