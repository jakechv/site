     <p><span>general plan:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> use beakl layout for thumb clusters</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> use the modified colemak variant for the qwerty keys</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> think hard about how to arrange the alternate layers</span>
