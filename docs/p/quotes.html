   <p><span>The best way to measure how much you&#39;ve grown</span>
   <p><span>isn&#39;t by inches or the number of</span>
   <p><span>laps you can now run around the track,</span>
   <p><span>or even your grade point average - though</span>
   <p><span>those things are important, to be sure.</span>
   <p><span>It&#39;s what you&#39;ve done with your time,</span>
   <p><span>how you&#39;ve chosen to spend your days,</span>
   <p><span>and whom you&#39;ve touched this year.</span>
   <p><span>That, to me, is the greatest measure of</span>
   <p><span>success.</span>
   <p><span>“A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at 
     night, and in between he does what he wants to do.”</span>
   <p><span>― Bob Dylan</span>
   <p><span>something something olin shivers reject things machines can do</span>

   <p><span>&quot;I would like this to signal the end of &quot;wasted angst&quot; in 
     my life: I’ve never regretted anything so much as having particular individual 
     worries, in a certain sense anachronistic ones, whereas general worries, worries 
     about our time (or at any rate those that can be reduced to such: like your 
     problem in paying the rent, for instance) are so many and so vast and so much 
     &quot;my own&quot; that I feel they are enough to fill all my 
     &quot;worryability&quot; and even my interest and enjoyment in living. So from 
     now on I want to dedicate myself entirely to these latter (worries) — but I am 
     already aware of the traps in this question and that&#39;s why for some time now 
     my first need has been to &quot;de-journalistize&quot; myself, to get myself out 
     of the stranglehold that has dominated these last few years of my life, reading 
     books to review immediately, commenting on something even before having to time 
     to form an opinion on it. I want to build a new kind of daily program for myself 
     where I can finally get into something, something definitive (within the limits 
     of historical possibility), something not dishonest or insincere (unlike the way 
     today’s journalist always behaves, more or less). For that reason I make several 
     plans for myself: ... to maintain my contacts with reality and the world, but 
     being careful, of course, not to get lost in unnecessary activities; and also to 
     set up my own individual work not as a &quot;journalist&quot; any more but as a 
     &quot;scholar,&quot; with systematic readings, notes, comments, notebooks, a 
     load of things I&#39;ve never done; and also, eventually, to write a 
     novel.&quot;</span>

   <p><span>&quot;At midnight, alone on the shore. One moment more and then I shall 
     set sail. The sky itself has weighed anchor, with all its stars, like those 
     ships which at this very hour gleam throughout the world with all their lights 
     and illuminate dark harbour waters. Space and silence weigh equally upon the 
     heart. A sudden love, a great work, a decisive act, a thought which 
     transfigures, all these at certain moments bring the same unbearable anxiety, 
     linked with an irresistible charm. Is living like this in the delicious anguish 
     of being, in exquisite proximity to a danger whose name we do not know the same 
     as rushing to our doom? Once again, without respite, let us go.</span>
   <p><span>I have always felt that I was living on the high seas, threatened, at the 
     heart of a royal happiness.&quot;</span>

   <p><span>&quot;Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. 
     Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by 
     definition, not smart enough to debug it.&quot;</span>

   <p><span>“It is an act of cowardice to seek from (or to wish to give) the people 
     we love any other consolation than that which works of art give us. These help 
     us through the mere fact that they exist. To love and to be loved only serves 
     mutually to render this existence more concrete, more constantly present to the 
     mind.&quot;</span>
