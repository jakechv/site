   <h2>Barcodes</h2>
   <p><span>These are tempting, but it seems like it could be a bad idea to 
     &#39;hardcode&#39; a URL that might not function properly in the future -- 
     there&#39;s no good way for me to own a domain name without tying it to a 
     specific product or service.</span>
   <p><span>I&#39;m wondering if I should spec into the blockchain URLs with 
     arbitrary extensions now or in the future; those seem like the most reliable way 
     to capture truly permanent links, so long as the heuristic is supported by major 
     browser engines.</span>

     redundancy and a different look.</span>

   <h2>NFC Implants</h2>
   <p><span>I&#39;d like to eventually get one of these, but the capacity of storage 
     is increasing incredibly rapidly, and the ability of these implants has not 
     quite cut up.</span>
   <p><span></span><a href=\"https://dangerousthings.com/\">DangerousThings</a><span>, 
     probably the best place now to purchase one of these implants.</span>
