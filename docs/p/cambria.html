  <ul>
   <li><span> api request -&gt; stack of transformations -&gt; sent to application 
     logic back and forth</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> this allows older apis to transform up the stack into a modern server</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> when distributing: need compatibility of multiple schemas</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> what would it look like to have good tools for handling distributed 
     systems in a systematic way? (shotgun parsing - parsing by if statements - 
     riddling code with little tests and hoping things stick. tools like protobuf in 
     the long term means only adding optional fields, and eventually the data schema 
     has entirely optional types - how do you know what&#39;s still relevant at all?)</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> manage schema compatibility separate from application logic!</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> - provide data transformations; &#39;bidirectional lenses&#39; - one 
    transformation for the whole schema, as written in a DSL.</span>
  <p><span> - graph of connected schemas and associated lenses. show how the schemas 
    connect with those lenses</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> cambria then:</span>
  </ul>
  <p><span> - automatically translates data at runtime</span>
  <p><span> - provides ts type definitions as well as JSON schemas for your code. 
    json&#39;s checkable at runtime as needed!</span>
  <p><span> - integration with Automerge CRDT</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> what is the pushpin architecture (from ink and switch?)</span>
  </ul>
