     <h3>Baked Chicken Parmesean</h3>
     <p><span>Sauce:</span>
     <p><span>1</span><span>4 cup extra virgin olive oil</span>
     <p><span>2 garlic cloves, peeled, finely chopped (about 2 teaspoons)</span>
     <p><span>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes (we use Muir-Glen)</span>
     <p><span>1</span><span>2 teaspoon dried basil (or 1 Tbsp of chopped fresh basil)</span>
     <p><span>1</span><span>4 teaspoon dried oregano (or 1 teaspoon of chopped fresh 
       oregano)</span>
     <p><span>1</span><span>4 teaspoon sugar</span>
     <p><span>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</span>
     <p><span>Chicken:</span>
     <p><span>3 Tbsp Dijon mustard</span>
     <p><span>1 Tbsp white-wine vinegar</span>
     <p><span>1</span><span>2 teaspoon salt</span>
     <p><span>1</span><span>2 teaspoon black pepper</span>
     <p><span>1 1</span><span>2 pounds chicken breast cutlets (or skinless boneless 
       chicken breasts or</span>
     <p><span>thighs that have been pounded to a 1</span><span>4-inch thickness)</span>
     <p><span>1 cup of breadcrumbs (panko or homemade)</span>
     <p><span>1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</span>
     <p><span>3 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted</span>
     <p><span>1 Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan on medium high 
       heat.</span>
     <p><span>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</span>
     <p><span>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, sugar, a pinch of salt and 
       pepper. Bring to a simmer.</span>
     <p><span>Continue to simmer until sauce thickens a bit and flavors meld, about 
       10-12 minutes. Taste sauce, adjust seasoning if necessary, cover and keep warm.</span>
     <p><span>2 Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with foil, parchment, or 
       Silpat. While the sauce is simmering, prepare the chicken in the next steps.</span>
     <p><span>3 Make the coating: In a large bowl whisk together the mustard, vinegar, 
       salt, and 1</span><span>4 teaspoon of pepper.</span>
     <p><span>Add the chicken cutlets to the mixture and coat well on both sides.</span>
     <p><span>4 Dredge the chicken: In another bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, 
       grated Parmesan, and 1</span><span>4 teaspoon of black pepper. Mix well and stir 
       in the melted butter. Transfer to a shallow plate.</span>
     <p><span>Dredge the chicken pieces in the breadcrumb mixture, gently pressing the 
       breadcrumbs into the chicken cutlets. Place dredged chicken on the lined baking 
       sheet.</span>
     <p><span>5 Bake: Bake at 450°F on the center rack of the oven until cooked and 
       golden</span>
     <p><span>brown, about 15 minutes.</span>
     <p><span>6 Serve: Serve with a side of rice, noodles or pasta. Ladle sauce with 
       the chicken.</span>
