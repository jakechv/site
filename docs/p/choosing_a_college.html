   <h1>Choosing A College</h1>
   <p><span>Here is some advice I&#39;ve compiled regarding selecting and attending a 
     university in the US.</span>
   <section>
    <h2>Finding Colleges</h2>
    <p><span>Though imperfect, the </span><span> provides a fairly accurate guideline 
      to the</span>
    <p><span>best colleges in the US. Take the rankings with a grain of salt, but 
      remember that the</span>
    <p><span>ranking of the university has some significance:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Universities with higher rankings typically have more funding for each 
       student</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> College name recognition makes finding a job much easier and brings 
       desired companies to your school</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Higher rankings are likely to attract students of a higher caliber</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span>Rankings should by no means help you make your final decision,</span>
    <p><span>but looking into the top colleges overall and in your field of interest 
      will help</span>
    <p><span>give you a better idea of what makes these schools appealing, and perhaps 
      what type of</span>
    <p><span>environment you would like out of those top choices.</span>
    <section>
     <h3>Do you have a particular interest in the field you would like to pursue?</h3>
     <p><span>If so, look at the faculty at each university who could be relevant to 
       your interests</span>
     <p><span>and more strongly consider colleges at which there is a concentrated 
       interest</span>
     <p><span>in a specific topic. Even if you do not have a specific interest in a 
       field,</span>
     <p><span>a department with a depth of knowledge in a particular area is likely to 
       enhance</span>
     <p><span>the potential for learning &#39;depth&#39; throughout your undergraduate 
       cirriculum.</span>
     <p><span>, for example, is a website dedicated to tracking research</span>
     <p><span>output and weighting institutions based on their graduate research 
       strengths.</span>
     <p><span>Other disciplines have similar rankings systems that can be looked at for 
       guidance.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>What do you want to do outside of college?</h3>
     <p><span>The location of the university is one of the most important aspects of 
       the decision.</span>
     <p><span>It&#39;ll determine what you have access to in your free time, the kind 
       of people you&#39;ll connect</span>
     <p><span>with, the place you&#39;ll have the most connections in and eventually 
       could play a hand in</span>
     <p><span>the location of your employment. Read a bit about the 
       &#39;personality&#39; of the city or town</span>
     <p><span>that each college resides in, watch some videos, and visit if you can. 
       The environment</span>
     <p><span>is the part of the college selection process that is most difficult to 
       quantify, and takes</span>
     <p><span>knowing a bit more about what you want to determine.</span>
     <p><span>If you&#39;re looking into a smaller school or a school in a small town, 
       make sure that the</span>
     <p><span>school or locale offers the resources to do things you enjoy. You might 
       be hard-pressed to</span>
     <p><span>find a golf course in Oberlin, Ohio, for example.</span>
     <p><span>If you don&#39;t have a strong urge to live in a given place, that&#39;s 
       fine -- you&#39;ll be able to</span>
     <p><span>better optimize for academic interests, and you&#39;re likely to meet 
       plenty of friends at any</span>
     <p><span>college you choose to attend.</span>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Assembling a List</h2>
    <p><span>Now that you have a variety of colleges you&#39;re interested in, 
      it&#39;s time to get</span>
    <p><span>a bit more realistic.</span>
    <p><span>Applying to top schools with acceptance rates in the single digits is 
      more or less a lottery.</span>
    <p><span>Admissions staff spend as little as five minutes looking at each 
      application and colleges often</span>
    <p><span>select for a particular student profile -- newsworthy accomplishments 
      nonwithstanding,</span>
    <p><span>even the best candidates can lose the college lottery.</span>
    <section>
     <h3>The Portfolio</h3>
     <p><span>As such, it&#39;s best to develop a &#39;portfolio&#39; of colleges with 
       a variety of different risk factors.</span>
     <p><span>Critically examine yourself, your scores, and your extracirriculars and 
       identify what colleges expect.</span>
     <p><span>Colleges are required to report their 25th percentile and 75th percentile 
       SAT and ACT test scores</span>
     <p><span>for admissions, and often describe what type of students they&#39;re 
       looking for on their websites. You can use</span>
     <p><span>this information in conjunction with other resources (described below) to 
       determine if a school is right for you.</span>
     <p><span>These factors depend on the individual and their circumstances, but you 
       likely want a spread similar to the following, assuming applications to about 
       ten different schools:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> 2-3 top schools. These are the best schools money can buy in your 
        field; the colleges you&#39;d love to attend.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span> Your test scores are a match for their high expectations and your 
       extracirriculars may be considered</span>
     <p><span> by the colleges as defining characteristics. Regardless of financial 
       constraint, it&#39;s important to apply to at least one &#39;dream&#39; 
       institution -- otherwise, you&#39;ll be left wondering what could have been.</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> 3-3 &#39;match&#39; schools. These are good schools you feel your 
        profile is a good match for -- they have relatively forgiving acceptance rates 
        and your test scores are compatible with their expectations. You would be very 
        happy attending one of these schools, and they provide a good balance between 
        financial viability, quality of academics and other considerations.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> 2-3 &#39;safety&#39; schools. These are schools for which your test 
        scores are in the 75th percentile or higher. They have high acceptance rates 
        relative to your other choices and you&#39;re confident that you would be 
        accepted here. These may not be located in your favorite city, or may not have 
        the best ranked program, but they&#39;re good default options to pursue in case 
        your other applications don&#39;t go well.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> 1-2 &#39;scholarship&#39; schools. These schools are safety schools 
        that might not be as appealing academically, but carry financial benefit -- 
        they&#39;re schools that are very likely to provide a significant amount of 
        merit-based financial aid. UT Dallas is a notable example of this -- I&#39;d 
        recommend that everyone at least considers the school given their willingness to 
        provide significant scholarships to out of state and international students to 
        well-qualified students. Even if money is currently no object, financial 
        circumstances can always change and it&#39;s good to be prepared for such an 
        eventuality.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span> </span><span> is a good place to start for finding such schools.</span>
     <p><span>Unless you have a strong idea of what you want from your college 
       experience, it&#39;s a good idea to apply to a diverse group of colleges (in 
       terms of location, campus values and prestige) rather than focusing on a 
       particular type of school. After all, your perspective on what you want from 
       college will change during the application process and as acceptances (and 
       reality) start to kick in as decision day approaches.</span>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p><span>There are lots of good resources to look into regarding college 
      applications in the US.</span>
    <p><span> and </span><span> are both forums on which students,</span>
    <p><span>admissions counselors, and parents seek and provide advice for students 
      looking to find the right college.</span>
    <p><span>These forums are the best place to seek answers regarding college 
      admissions.</span>
    <p><span>Be warned: it&#39;s easy to become caught up in their obsession over 
      ranking and prestige.</span>
    <p><span>Your personal interests will </span><span>always</span><span> matter more 
      than a perceived ranking or reputation that</span>
    <p><span>a certain college holds.</span>
    <p><span>Specific admissions blogs can help you learn more about the individual 
      experiences of many</span>
    <p><span>college students, their individual college experiences and their 
      perspectives on the universities</span>
    <p><span>they attend. One of my favorites is the </span><span> -- it has 
      consistently great writing</span>
    <p><span>and genuine insight from MIT students with a variety of backgrounds.</span>
    <p><span>The subreddits and Facebook groups for individual colleges (for example, 
      https:</span><span>reddit.com</span><span>r</span><span>neu)</span>
    <p><span>provide insight into the day to day lives of students on campus and can 
      help you feel out the campus culture.</span>
    <p><span>These are relatively easy to find -- just look up the college&#39;s name 
      on the appropriate platform.</span>
    <p><span>Be warned that the students typically posting the most are typically 
      those with the most to complain about, though; read about complaints students 
      have, but don&#39;t take them for granted as attributes of the school.</span>
    <p><span>College &#39;vlogs&#39; or &#39;tours&#39; on YouTube are, in my opinion, 
      the best way to get a &#39;feel&#39; for the university;</span>
    <p><span>there tend to be a few students at most schools passionate about making 
      such videos and showcasing their</span>
    <p><span>experiences. For example, </span><span>.</span>

    <h2>Your Choice Doesn&#39;t Matter</h2>
    <p><span>Though this decision is an incredibly important one, don&#39;t spend too 
      much time worrying about it.</span>
    <p><span>Wherever you go, you&#39;ll be able to find a community of those who with 
      the same interests and</span>
    <p><span>professors who share your academic passions. You&#39;ll warm up to the 
      location too.</span>
    <p><span>College is just four years of your life; make the most of it, but 
      don&#39;t spend too much time worried. You&#39;ll have a good experience 
      regardless of where you end up.</span>
