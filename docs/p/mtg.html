   <h1>Magic The Gathering</h1>
   <p><span>I&#39;ve been playing magic the gathering on and off for about ten years. 
     my relationship with the game has changed -- starting as something that 
     resembles a board game, my understanding of the game adapted and i became a 
     collector, then a competitor, then a collector again.</span>
   <p><span>With recent administrative decisions leading to both mass bans and 
     unhealthy card liquidation, I&#39;ll no longer be partaking in the game&#39;s 
     ecosystem. It&#39;s unhealthy to dedicate time to something so inherently 
     capitalist anyways. </span>
