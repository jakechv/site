  <h1>Personal Websites</h1>
  <p><span>I love the personal website; it says so much about who someone is, what 
    they stand for, and how they&#39;d like to represent themselves - from both a 
    technical and an aesthetic perspective. One of my favorite pastimes is browsing 
    these sites and trying to learn more about the people behind them.</span>

       that involves placing blocks in various places, build with a combination of hugo

       as well as shows a scrolling interface through their source code. I should make 
       a website like this to showcase my own projects via the github api! See </span>

       playable inside a game boy! This is a major motivation for me to work on this 
       wiki platform -- I want a single source of truth for all of my web spaces, but I 
       also want to be able to render different representations of my website depending 
       on how I&#39;d like to display it at any given time. The question is, though, 
       how I should best separate these concerns!</span>
