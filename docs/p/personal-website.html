   <h1>Personal Websites</h1>
   <p><span>I love the personal website; it says so much about who someone is, what 
     they stand for, and how they&#39;d like to represent themselves - from both a 
     technical and an aesthetic perspective. One of my favorite pastimes is browsing 
     these sites and trying to learn more about the people behind them.</span>
   <p><span>My site can be found at https:</span><span>jacob.chvatal.com.</span>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>Animated</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: An excellent game on his website that involves placing 
        blocks in various places, build with a combination of hugo and node. uses 
        twien.js to show some great animations working!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Love that this fetches projects from git as well as 
        shows a scrolling interface through their source code. I should make a website 
        like this to showcase my own projects via the github api! See https:</span>
       <span>github.com</span><span>jakeisnt</span><span>projects.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: There is so much dynamism here! Very enjoyable to 
        interact with.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Lots fo detail but none of it is distracting. So many 
        important articles!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: It&#39;s a personal website that&#39;s playable inside 
        a game boy! This is a major motivation for me to work on this wiki platform -- I 
        want a single source of truth for all of my web spaces, but I also want to be 
        able to render different representations of my website depending on how I&#39;d 
        like to display it at any given time. The question is, though, how I should best 
        separate these concerns!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This rendered animation in the background is... a lot.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Just incredible! Like an old windows machine, complete 
        with animated screensaver if the user stops browsing for awhile.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Another web portal; this feels so much more modern. I 
        love the idea of developing little applets and running them inside the web 
        portal. The bootup page is fantastic as well!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This is a website I&#39;d love to have if I were more 
        of a designer. I love how cluttered it is, displaying tons of information yet 
        managing it super well. Seriously </span><span> design that&#39;s incredible to 
        follow. Love that they&#39;re now pursuing a school of architecture after 
        working at Google!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: fun website for checking out festivals - with ants?</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This is just a circle with several social media links, 
        but I </span><span>love</span><span> the animations that go along with it. The 
        source code can be found </span><span>.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: The eyes that flash when you first open the site </span>
       <span>make</span><span> this experience!</span>
     </ul>

     <h3>Beyond web</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span> a website that interfaces with a physical device, a pi, 
        and flashes a smiley face whenever someone visits the page. lends some personal, 
        physical characteristics to an otherwise void webspace. they also have very good 
        book recommendations</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>an incredible array of wild designs, designed to resemble 
        a window system. i&#39;m getting some rugrats, early 2000s energy from this one.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span> :: Love mousing over the different subjects to view more 
        detail about them throughout the website. Incredibly well-designed work.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Minimal</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: I patterned my current website after mikhail&#39;s. 
        It&#39;s incredibly minimal and feels mysterious and personal at the same time.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Love the phone animation, the fading blue text, the red 
        border, and all of the sections showcasing little art projects in between. Great 
        model!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Big fan of her fits and her web work doesn&#39;t 
        disappoint - done in good taste. Love the functionality of the interactive 
        menus.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: No CSS! Super communicative with brief descriptions of 
        all of their projects and interests. There is no mystery to what they&#39;ve 
        made.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: &quot;And the gears notch and the engines wheel.&quot;</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: incredibly simple. super easy to read their website 
        just by looking at it. wish there were more substance though...</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: the minimalism speaks to a lot of their 
        accomplishments; seems like a very impressive person.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: They fille the space incredibly well with this design, 
        even though it&#39;s clearly designed with minimalism in mind. Love that 
        navigation and &#39;back&#39; are entirely built into the site. Try this out for 
        a personal website sometime.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This is incredible! The website is *blurry*. Figure out 
        how this is accomplished!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: That ascii art is beautiful. I love how much dynamism 
        it adds to their website without having to introduce any graphics. I wonder if 
        there&#39;s some way to generate cool ascii art to showcase on different 
        websites...</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Phrased introduction similar to my website but with 
        much more information on it. It&#39;s worth considering adding more words to 
        mine; this reads very well.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: I love the frames! This website has some excellent 
        design work behind it.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This isn&#39;t exactly javascript minimal, but the 
        scrolling feels incredible here.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: The font is a bit strong - don&#39;t think I&#39;m a 
        fan of the headings - but I like a lot of Aaron&#39;s ideas!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: That graphic at the top is some incredible work. I love 
        the dots and zig-zags - not something that&#39;s seen often!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: No CSS! This is a </span><span> researcher for sure. 
        Lots of interesting projects to check out.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Love the boxes and colors!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Of the essay type, from a very impressive and prolific 
        programmer working on systems and programming languages tasks. Their </span>
       <span> is definitely worth a peek as well.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Love how minimal this site is with little to no design 
        requirements.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Such a fun site to navigate. Shoutout to Sam. Easy and 
        fun to use; the animations are excellent.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Great blocks with lots of dotgrid styles!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Incredibly simple. Shows project name and collaborators 
        every time. Great source of inspiration for web development; lots to learn here. 
        Their project here: </span><span>seems super useful as well.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Incredibly simple and easy to navigate!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Incredible logo on the main page. Their bookmarks are 
        also super useful and relevant as well.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: The projects and work experience are put front and 
        center here. Love the styling they&#39;ve used for navigating their journal - 
        apt reflection on personal experiences - as well as their colors and choices. 
        Read their writing and learn to write more like them! It all seems to just flow 
        together.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: There is very little here but it feels like a bridge to 
        a ton of content.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Another iteration on a simple, clean design that&#39;s 
        super easy to navigate.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Resume-Like</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: I love the look of this. It feels just like a resume, 
        but it&#39;s able to accurately and properly communicate all of their interests, 
        projects and accomplishments!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Great </span><span> showcase of works under a 
        foundation.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This is so fun to navigate. Hints for finding hidden 
        secrets are throughout the website!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Great layout of work and great font choice. </span>
       <span>is inspirational.</span>

     <h3>Brutalist</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Great overview of lots of minimal books.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Seems like a super fun person. Simple blog theme.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Love this layout. The plants put a positive twist on 
        brutalism that I&#39;m a huge fan of. They have super interesting projects too! </span>
       <span>is of particular note.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Yes!</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Quirky/Novel</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: A bit of a sloppy site that generates random training 
        workouts. Love the slapped together aesthetic that feels both quick and 
        deliberate; if it weren&#39;t purposeful, there would certainly be more padding 
        issues.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This website is a conversation - a choose your own 
        adventure that walks the reader through their accomplishments! Great work.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: The personal website as a dungeon crawler.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: All of the wild visuals, graphics and navigation quirks 
        here make this site incredibly fun to navigate. I&#39;ve never seen anything 
        like it!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: An incredible brutalist theme and work. This is a joy 
        to browse and explore; it has just enough color to engage the user but is 
        minimal enough to not distract from the art and content that&#39;s such a focal 
        point of the site.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Blog</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Nice layout here; great font and spacing. Love the 
        light interaction hovering over each article. Shows just the right amount of 
        information with good enough padding.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This &#39;devlog&#39;, as it&#39;s labeled, catalogues 
        a lot of cool visual code experiments. Love the way it&#39;s concisely presented 
        - and the style really stays out of the way.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: I don&#39;t think that this was a conscious effort or a 
        particular exercise in web design, but I love how easy it is to see exactly what 
        Brendan&#39;s written and worked on!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Little more than a feed of different animated web 
        experiments; I love that it showcases all of these cool code animations. 
        Definitely a great source of inspiration for some 3D tidbits. It would be 
        excellent if I could add this feature in this </span><span>!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: this website looks like it&#39;s completely handwritten 
        - it could have been composed on my remarkable. love the look. worth trying out 
        for a project of my own!</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Retro</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Incredible visual that looks like a boot screen.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This website doesn&#39;t say much of anything, but I 
        love the waves of ascii characters that are generated and displayed!</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: A website that looks just like a manpage! Love how 
        simple it is as well as the blinking cursor at the bottom.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Love the blocks here. Excellent choice of font as well. 
        Feels retro and modern at the same time! Wish there were a bit more padding... 
        The loading animation looks incredible but it&#39;s a bit annoying when 
        interacting with the site for longer periods of time.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Wonderful text and code animations. It&#39;s so 
        exciting to watch this! Definitely inspired - look into how these things can be 
        imitated.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: A terminal hosted at the top of the website! Shares 
        similar values in terms of sustainable web design as well : )</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: This looks just like a BIOS screen - perhaps it&#39;s 
        meant to resemble an old not-quite-computer-GUI though. I love the loading 
        animation and the color scheme; really feels like I&#39;m booting up an ancient 
        IBM machine.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: inspired by retro computing and classic mac window 
        management. love all of the little quirks hiding on the site and the gifs! great 
        way to present previous projects as well. her friend </span><span>&#39;s website 
        is incredibly well designed as well.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Photography</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: Excellent inspiration for different photography 
        websites.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>:: I love how this site captures the photographic process, 
        and the boxed animations are an excellent touch.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>

    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span>:: book recommendations! fun blog theme! i love how this 
       person ties together the responses they make on different social media websites 
       and posts this all publicly on their website. I should look into setting up a
