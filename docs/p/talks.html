    <p><span>removing animals of nay dignified cuteness; bojack horseman is pretty 
      close</span>
    <p><span>to this uncanny valley of creepy absurdism. the desire is not to make the</span>
    <p><span>animals cute so much as lifelike and uncomfortable.</span>
    <p><span>bojack as a horse :: horse, long face, depression, juxtaposition of a</span>
    <p><span>majestic animal as an alcoholic, etc. horse bredfor transportation but 
      the</span>
    <p><span>role no longer fulfulls the animal; could come from some broader interest 
      in</span>
    <p><span>horses</span>
    <p><span>the main characters are drawn from domestic animals !</span>
    <p><span>four legs good . two legs better . the control we have over domestic 
      animals</span>
    <p><span>is associated with the characters chosen for the show .</span>
    <p><span>pushing the potential of animation to allow emotional states to hae an 
      impact</span>
    <p><span>on the world through cartoon absurdism ! the animalism enables them to 
      reveal</span>
    <p><span>the primal instincts of humans</span>
    <p><span>blind recreation to create images that are readable.</span>
    <p><span>diane. sometimes, life is a bitch; then, you keep living.</span>
