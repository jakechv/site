   <h1>Modern Suppliers</h1>
   <ul>
    <li><span> leverage software to lower barrier to entry</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> provide tooling too difficult and resource intensive for in house work</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> align incentives with customers; i.e. pay per use enabling scaling. 
      api, saas, business in a box, etc... AWS is a huge deal in this space - with it 
      companies have no need to worry about their own server infrastructures!</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>given the right business model, you grow directly alongside your 
     consumer; i.e. twilio supports whatsapp substantially and considerably. stripe 
     is probably the best example of this! all you have to do to accept payments is 
     dispatch to strip : )</span>
   <p><span>Aldo Leopold: &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot;</span>
   <p><span>spiritual dangers to not owning a farm:</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> supposing that heat comes from the furnace</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>you can build these in house, eventually!</span>
   <p><span>becoming a good theoretical computer science:</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> theoretical fields are so important to practical advancements</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> math and physics are vital to pursuing any theoretical field</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>to become a good computer science researcher, study math. you will always 
     have time to switch to the &#39;practical side of the force&#39;, but it&#39;s 
     worth spending time to hone engineering </span>
   <p><span>turing machines and the halting problem. the Entscheindunsproblem created 
     the turing machine and the turing test -- determined that the mathematics are 
     decidable, evaluating a definite procedure to show if a math statement is true 
     or false</span>
   <p><span>the question prompted an answer: the turing machine!</span>
   <p><span>Mathematical Theory of communication set the foundation for 
     telecommunications - but in and of itself is not! Shannon&#39;s information 
     theory of entropy takes thermodynamic entropy and transforms it to impact 
     communications</span>
   <p><span>shannon theorem, shannon-hartley theorem</span>
   <p><span>the class mip* of languages cna be decided by a verifier is equal to RE, 
     recursively enumerable languages! read more, @adlarocha</span>
