   <h1>Ethical Web</h1>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Backlinks :: </span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>Thoughts on the current state of the web and taking action to make it 
     more ethical.</span>
   <p><span>The modern web often forces all developers to adhere to more and more 
     specifications (have you seen how long and convoluted the RFC manual is?), and 
     lives in a world where only the companies that create the standards can 
     practically adhere to them.</span>
   <p><span>This is bad abstraction! This process is no different from forcing 
     everyone who *uses* a technology to add specific components to their work rather 
     than taking on this responsibility as the browser.</span>
   <p><span>Of course, information like a robots.txt, a webpage title and these sorts 
     of things should be standardized and mandated by the user -- but there are lots 
     of sensible defaults, like keyboard-navigable websites, that could be applied 
     and later overridden by the user if they don&#39;t like these defaults.</span>

    <h2>Web Minimalism</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>Size Compression</h3>
     <p><span>There are transpilers and minifying tools, but to best optimize for small 
       websites you might as well roll your own static site generator. I&#39;ve been 
       using Python&#39;s Jinja2 template engine but I&#39;m sure there are better 
       options.</span>
     <p><span>Lots of resources suggest that your site, or its critical resources at 
       the least, should fit in the first ten packets:</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> https:</span><span>www.tunetheweb.com</span><span>blog</span><span>
        critical-resources-and-the-first-14kb</span>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <p><span> :: the web app should act exactly as one would expect a typical website 
      to do. Back buttons should be reproduced to have consistent behavior at the 
      last!</span>

      <li><span> </span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Axe-core (+Storybook a11y addon): checks rendered HTML for 
        accessibility; browser extensions and react integrations are both available</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> </span><span>: browser extension to examine how those with different 
        color vision deficiencies will view the application</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Tab through you application! Make sure that the tab key proceeds in an 
        order that makes sense. A &#39;skip navigation&#39; link should appear the first 
        time the &#39;Tab&#39; key is pressed (a la GitHub) to enable users to tab 
        through the relevant content rather than the heading.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Always try to zoom to 200%; many users use the web this way! The size 
        should behave in exactly the same way.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Use a screen reader to browse. This will ensure that your semantic 
        markup, interactive elements and other utilities are up to spec.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Open content in browser reading mode; ensure that the minimum viable 
        amount of content is available.</span>

      </ul>
      <ul>

         determined via text. Tags, aria labels and semantic elements should be used to 
         strictly define navigable websites.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> The purpose of an element must always be determined independent of the 
         component, icon or region (use names and text everywhere).</span>

       <li><span> Never use color as the only means of conveying information.</span>
      </ul>

       <li><span> Contrast ratio is very important, and text should be resized 200%+ 
         without loss of content or functionality.</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> No loss of content functionality occurs from:</span>
      </ul>
      <p><span> - Line height 1.5x</span>
      <p><span> - Spacing 2x</span>
      <p><span> - Letter spacing 0.12x</span>
      <p><span> - Word spacing 0.16x</span>

       <li><span> Link purpose can be determined by link text alone</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> More than one way to locate a web page</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Focus always visible</span>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><span> Pointer gestures very important! Target at least 44x44 CSS pixels</span>
      </ul>

      <h4>Understandable</h4>
      <ul>

      <p><span> - Submissions are reversible</span>

     <h3>Tips</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Episodic memory can be hard. Introduce product features gradually.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Never divide screen into multiple actions.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Provide clear feedback on progress or completion</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Provide reminders and alerts for habitual actions</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Do not assume anything; abbreviations, acronyms, scrolling, search, 
        back button</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Long-form text is okay as long as attention is focused</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Font size of *at least* 16px.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Always pair icons and symbols with text.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Avoid using blue for colors and never use color to convey a message.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Reduce the distance between sequential interface elements. Buttons 
        should be at least 9.6mm diagonally for ages up to 70.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Interface elements to be clicked with a mouse should be at least 11mm 
        diagonally.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Clear, bold headings to gravitate to are vital to navigation.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Standard treatments for links should be used as they&#39;re familiar.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Buttons and links should all be clearly labeled and show that 
        they&#39;ve been clicked; some graphic buttons can be distracting rather than 
        informative, and here text is better.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Use static menus -- leading to another apge on click - rather than 
        walking menus -- exposing a sub menu. Sub menus should be on click rather than 
        hover.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Do error pages provide a robust description to the user?</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Is there a clear site map available from every page that provides an 
        overview of the entire site?</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Can the page be skimmed? Is there an easy starting point? If pages are 
        dense is it grouped?</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Is there an obvious way to increase the font size?</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Is the content written in the active voice?</span>
     </ul>
