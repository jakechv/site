   <h1>Attachment</h1>
   <p><span>I played the Pokemon trading card game for many years.</span>
   <p><span>Every day after school was another day to fit cards between the slats</span>
   <p><span>of the old wooden bench on my front porch, lining up dozens of Pokemon</span>
   <p><span>to fight against my neighbor&#39;s deck.</span>
   <p><span>I&#39;ve always dreamt that the cards would go to another good home with 
     kids</span>
   <p><span>who would treasure the cards as much as I have, obsessively sorting them</span>
   <p><span>to build the best decks with the coolest cards.</span>
   <p><span>One year, these cards traveled with me to a tournament on the morning of 
     my</span>
   <p><span>brother&#39;s birthday. I&#39;d spent the whole evening crafting and 
     preparing my deck to</span>
   <p><span>destroy the competition -- I&#39;d even gotten a new card, the </span><i>
     Typhlosion Prime</i><span>,</span>
   <p><span>that I hoped would help me best them.</span>
   <p><span>&quot;You need sleeves to play with cards like that!&quot;</span>
   <p><span>&quot;Sorry, but you have five copies of </span><i>Ponyta</i><span> in 
     your deck.</span>
   <p><span>You&#39;ll have to remove one to play.&quot;</span>
   <p><span>Yesterday I sold my collection of Pokemon cards for </span>
    <pre></pre>
   <p><span>As she left, the woman mentioned she knew some people who might be</span>
   <p><span>interested in some of the old cards -- that she&#39;d have an easy time</span>
   <p><span>flipping them to make a lot of money.</span>
   <p><span>I don&#39;t care.</span>
