   <h2>The strength of being misunderstood</h2>
   <p><span>https://blog.samaltman.com/</span>
   <p><span>The most impressive people care a lot about what others think - anyone - 
     but they only care on a long time horizon, as so long as the history books get 
     it right the work is justified.</span>
   <p><span>Trade short term status for long term; most people are unwilling to do 
     this, but it&#39;s a sactifice worth making to become successful.</span>
   <p><span>As Mike said: pick up the camera, put down social media, and work for 10 
     years. Become an expert. Only then can you come out and show your talent to 
     everyone; you&#39;ll be most successful that wa; you&#39;ll be most successful 
     that way.</span>

   <p><span>The three gates of speech:</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> is it true?</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> is it necessary?</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> is it kind?</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>&quot;You should attempt to re-express your target&#39;s position so 
     clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, &quot;Thanks, I wish I&#39;d 
     thought of putting it that way.&quot;&quot;</span>
   <p><span>—Rapoport&#39;s First Rule</span>
   <p><span>&quot;How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely.&quot;</span>
   <p><span>—Kevin Kelly</span>
   <p><span>&quot;Kings speak for the realm, governors for the state, popes for the 
     church. Indeed, the titled, as titled, cannot speak with annyone.&quot;</span>
