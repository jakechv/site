    <h2>The strength of being misunderstood</h2>
    <p><span>https:</span><span>blog.samaltman.com</span>
    <p><span>The most impressive people care a lot about what others think - anyone - 
      but they only care on a long time horizon, as so long as the history books get 
      it right the work is justified.</span>
    <p><span>Trade short term status for long term; most people are unwilling to do 
      this, but it&#39;s a sactifice worth making to become successful.</span>
    <p><span>As Mike said: pick up the camera, put down social media, and work for 10 
      years. Become an expert. Only then can you come out and show your talent to 
      everyone; you&#39;ll be most successful that wa; you&#39;ll be most successful 
      that way.</span>

    <p><span>The three gates of speech:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> is it true?</span>
    </ul>

     <li><span> is it necessary?</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> is it kind?</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span>&quot;You should attempt to re-express your target&#39;s position so 
      clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, &quot;Thanks, I wish I&#39;d 
      thought of putting it that way.&quot;&quot;</span>

    <p><span>&quot;How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely.&quot;</span>

    <p><span>&quot;Kings speak for the realm, governors for the state, popes for the 
      church. Indeed, the titled, as titled, cannot speak with annyone.&quot;</span>
