   <ul>
    <li><span> ``There are wavelengths that people cannot see, there are sounds that 
      people cannot hear, and maybe computers have thoughts that people cannot 
      think.&#39;&#39;</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Shannon information theory?</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Hired as a clerk for the computers of people like Feynman and Shannon. 
      Kept asking &#39;why?&#39;</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> you must first tell yourself that you&#39;d like to do something 
      significant</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> there is always repitition we see in people who make impacts, like 
      Shannon. Partly luck but the only control we have over that is our circumstances</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> great work is not just &#39;brains&#39;; often the issue is with 
      articulation, a lack of an ability to access the language and forum necessary to 
      develop ideas</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> once you&#39;ve developed the courage to face - and solve - important 
      problems, you can - he postulates that this will lead to a stream of successes 
      if you stick to the method</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> the best stem work is often done early in the career while the best 
      literary work is often done late</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> do not define your scale by the problems you&#39;ve faced, Shannon 
      error</span>
   </ul>

   <h2>Research times from @random_walker</h2>
   <p><span>Knowing lots of things isn&#39;t important.</span>
   <p><span>What is important is:</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Knowing what you know and don&#39;t.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Being good at teaching what you know.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Admitting when you&#39;re incorrect.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Communicating uncertainty effectively.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Spotting bullshit.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Recognizing others with expertise.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Recognizing different domains of expertise.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Recognizing different kinds of expertise.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Drawing from the expertise of others without deferring to authourity.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Accepting the unknowable. Abstractions exist for a reason!</span>
   </ul>
