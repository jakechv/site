    <h2>designer living philosophy</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li><span> full-time freelancing: turn any place into a working space! work from 
       anywhere.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> live in a small studio with everything organized and functional. use a 
       small desk to stay focused!</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> work hard to build a concrete and strong routine. use external tracking 
       tools. keep good habits and balance; this matters more than anything else. (I 
       know this!)</span>
