   <h1>Cooking</h1>
   <p><span>I find cooking to be incredibly intimidating, but it&#39;s often the case 
     that many dishes are not difficult. Cooking is procedural precision with an eye 
     and a nose for good taste.</span>
   <p><span>As with other aspects of my life, I think it&#39;s important for what I 
     eat and make to be minimal. If I buy minimally processed ingredients myself, the 
     end result will be simple and healthy for me; the more processed an ingredient 
     is, the greater its propensity to have health symptoms and consequences.</span>

    <p><span> mom tips:</span>
    <p><span> - start with base; quinoa, brown rice, pasta</span>
    <p><span> - add toppings: roasted veggies, raw chopped veggies, cheese, beans</span>
    <p><span> - crunch: seeds, chips, chickpeas, croutons</span>
    <p><span> - sauce, dressing, salsa, sour cream, yogurt</span>
    <p><span> - chopped chicken or browned meat alternative on top of that</span>
