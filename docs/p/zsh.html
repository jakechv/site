  <h1>Zsh</h1>
  <p><span>Zsh, z-shell is a more flexible and configurable shell.</span>
  <p><span>It offers an enhanced scripting language as well as greater 
    configurability and pluggability over the standard shell while still 
    implementing both the POSIX standard and conventions. Used with bash, dash and 
    sh (as the POSIX standard is unfortunately far from complete).</span>
  <p><span>Ultimately I don&#39;t think ZSH is good as it&#39;s this sort of hacked 
    on super-bash; it doesn&#39;t </span><b>really</b><span> forward the goals of a 
    system</span>
