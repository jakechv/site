   <h1>Zsh</h1>
   <p><span>Zsh, z-shell is a more flexible and configurable shell.</span>
   <p><span>It offers an enhanced scripting language as well as greater 
     configurability and pluggability over the standard shell while still 
     implementing both the POSIX standard and conventions. Used with bash, dash and 
     sh (as the POSIX standard is unfortunately far from complete).</span>
   <p><span>Ultimately I don&#39;t think ZSH is good as it&#39;s this sort of hacked 
     on super-bash; it doesn&#39;t *really* forward the goals of a system</span>
