   <h1>Quantified Self</h1>
   <p><span>analyzing myself</span>
   <p><span>life logging is super important</span>
   <p><span>what things am i interested in processing?</span>
   <p>
   <p><span> good resource for tracking</span>
   <p>
   <p><span>doing things digitally automatically logs data for the timeline</span>
   <p><span>feels wrong that data can be forgotten and lost forever</span>
   <p><span>want to have the choice whether to forget or remember,</span>
   <p><span>and want to be able to access forgotten memories</span>
   <p><span>ultimately, i want this to be an effort to accomplish two things:</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> reduce the services i use</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> connect all of the services i use</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>and i want to be able to interface with all of them</span>
   <p><span>eventually, i would like to be able to open this ecosystem to others,</span>
   <p><span>and in doing so allow people to share events, memories and experiences</span>
