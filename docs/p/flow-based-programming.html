  <h1>Flow Based Programming</h1>
  <p><span>FBP is a programming paradigm that defines applications as networks</span>
  <p><span>of black-box processes, exchanging data across predefiend connections by 
    message passing.</span>
  <p><span>The connections are always specified external to these processes.</span>
  <p><span>This allows a product to be thought of as a holistic system just as much 
    as it is a selection</span>
  <p><span>of separate services.</span>
