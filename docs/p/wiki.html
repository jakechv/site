   <h1>Wiki</h1>
   <p><span>Wikis are tree-based tools for representing</span>
   <p><span>hierarchies of information.</span>
   <p><span>This personal wiki is the one I maintain.</span>
   <p><span>Others refer to personal wikis as </span><span>Digital Gardens</span>
    <span>,</span>
   <p><span>Brain Dumps</span><span>, or </span><span>Personal Libraries</span><span>
     .</span>
   <p><span>The source of this wiki can be found at </span><span>.</span>
   <section>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>Organization</h3>
     <p><span>I needed a way to better organize my ideas.</span>
     <p><span>Administering structure to my data was a good way</span>
     <p><span>to do this, and org-mode provides a good facility for this.</span>
     <p><span>Further, the constraints administered by the website motivate me to 
       better organize my notes as they&#39;re visible to the public; without this 
       structure the notes won&#39;t even render properly.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Accessibility</h3>
     <p><span>I&#39;d like my notes to be easily visible to anyone.</span>
     <p><span>It allows me to easily share my thoughts and perspectives with friends or 
       colleagues.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Publicity</h3>
     <p><span>This portal also enables recruiters or future collaborators to learn more 
       about me, my skills and my interests. Perhaps I can build a following, inspire 
       someone, or find an interesting job opportunity if someone stumbles upon this 
       wiki.</span>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span>Briefly summarize what you&#39;ve done each month and 
       year! This is excellent for reflection, learning and growth. It can be easily 
       contrasted with goals. I think that doing this on a monthly basis would be much 
       more helpful than yearly; perhaps I could introduce some tags to the wiki that 
       would help catalogue this.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span>:: Add a personal canon; catalogue the things that have 
       had the most impact on you. This could be difficult but it&#39;s worth 
       goingthrough the effort! Would be great to do some justice to each thing 
       that&#39;s inspired you.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span>:: Cataloguing a list of values on the website seems 
       incredibly value for myself or for others. These ideas are definitely admirable. 
       (Making connections with other people has a higher return than making good work, 
       it seems!)</span>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> tags :: </span><span>,</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span>The design of this wiki has gone through multiple phases.</span>
    <p><span>I started with a Hugo template, adding browsing features in multiple 
      panes to the site, but Hugo proved to be too complex of a tool to sustainably 
      use in the long term.</span>
    <p><span>The current iteration of this site is generated with a Pandoc-based tool 
      I&#39;ve written myself, as I felt I wanted more customizability. Eventually, 
      I&#39;d like to generate multiple front-ends for the website -- so that visitors 
      can view it as a wiki, as a traditional blog, a series of journals, or something 
      in between -- depending on how they view the website.</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>References</h2>
    <p><span>I&#39;ve taken inspiration from several others who maintain wikis.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span> first introduced me to the idea with his personal 
       (private) wiki.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span> has easily accessible articles and templates that 
       I&#39;ve made use of to put this together.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span> publish all of their notes and information in a custom 
       wiki framework.</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> </span><span> is a really cool tool for maintaining a personal knowledge 
      basin that syncs effortlessly with GitHub.</span>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p><span>cool wiki approach :: find the best method for me ! I think writing a 
      blog post is the best way to help me organize my thoughts, i should get that 
      infrastructure up. nextcloud notes is also a good option, but i do have to set 
      up a nextcloud server to handle that</span>

      don&#39;t intersect with the field.</span>

    <h2>concrete plan</h2>
    <p><span>learn to build small software! a wiki is the best way to do this.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> write a basic org-mode parser in ANSI </span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> supports links, </span><span>#+title</span><span>, nested bullets, etc. 
      fairly simple to start.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> with inspiration from devine&#39;s wiki, integrate this parser into a 
       service</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> that parses things out to html, also written in ANSI C</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> continue to rewrite in rust and other languages, like zig perhaps, for 
       fun and to learn more programming</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> experiment with a file format other than org under the hood; something 
       with an equivalent level</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> of expression but much simpler [i don&#39;t use most of the features of 
      org here anyways; org feels like it&#39;s</span>
    <p><span> doing too much as a file format, and i use different subsets of the 
      format in different ways]</span>
    <p><span> - would be cool to use a babel-adjacent technology to be able to convert 
      to file formats compatible with other platforms on the fly.</span>
    <section>
     <h3>experiments</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> figure out the best way to do project management. learn more about the 
        mailing list strategy adn see how that compares to a </span><span>TODO.org</span>
       <span> approach that I&#39;ve been using in a few of my projects to take notes 
        and ideas.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> build hyper specific tools to interact with my wiki in different ways 
        to enforce certain ways of integrating with it: adding a new idea, journal 
        entry, or something similar for example. emacs is a nice interface and should be 
        worked on, but it shouldn&#39;t be the only one. small, portable </span><span>
        .sh</span><span> scripts could be fun to experiment with here.</span>
     </ul>

    <h2>some new wiki ideas from issues</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> &#39;see the diff for this section&#39;: click the button to see the 
       page diff visualized over time. inspired by this: https:</span><span>
       mbuffett.com</span><span>posts</span><span>bevy-snake-tutorial</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> show &#39;last modified&#39;</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> estimate reading time</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> add link to newsletter signup</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> display stats on the main page:</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> - number of words</span>
    <p><span> - number of pages</span>
    <p><span> - number of links between pages</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> extract tags from each file and display things in sub-pages throughout 
       the wiki according to tags. this needs some exploration, and could be interfaced 
       with in addition to backlinks. this needs some investigation - how can i fuse 
       with other distributed wiki ideas?</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> (only with rust rewrite): support evaluation of code blocks during 
       generation. integrate with nix to install and use the right programs to run</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> (rust) export to gemini system, host on gemini server</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> ways to visualize history throughout the file to show what&#39;s 
       changed over time! perhaps a &#39;changed recently&#39; as well</span>
    </ul>
   </section>

    <h2>goula.sh</h2>
    <p><span> https:</span><span>goula.sh</span>
    <p><span> some excellent ideas</span>
    <p><span> - millions of tags!</span>
    <p><span> - lots of side notesz</span>
    <p><span> - feature highlights throughout the notes, interweaving them with the 
      writing</span>
    <p><span> </span>
    <p><span> - uses links as nodes, cataloguing references to them throughout the 
      writing.</span>
    <p><span> i can&#39;t read too much into this though - or i will begin to lose 
      creativity!</span>
    <p><span> - tracking aesthetics on one wiki page: https:</span><span>
      thomasorus.com</span><span>aesthetics.html</span>
    <p><span> - love the time graph here! maybe I should spend more time tracking. i 
      want a solution that does this in the background, though, to a degree...</span>
    <p><span> - </span><span>track a more consistent media diet. perhaps this is 
      possible with my review system in conjunction with git (and emails i have sent 
      myself) ?</span>
