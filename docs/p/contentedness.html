  <h1>Contentedness</h1>
  <p><span></span><a href=https://tynan.com/content>article</a><span></span>
  <p><span>We care a lot about the things we tend to dismiss, and we are pretty 
    picky.</span>
  <p><span>There are *aspects* of concepts we&#39;re interested in and not 
    interested in.</span>
  <p><span>What does &#39;caring&#39; about something mean?</span>
  <p><span>What does contentedness mean?</span>
  <p><span>We choose to appreciate things in our lives based on how we live them; we 
    choose what matters most to us adn what doesn&#39;t.</span>
  <p><span>We should truly appreciate what we have rather than striving to 
    appreciate the things that we don&#39;t.</span>
  <p><span>It&#39;s also important to avoid letting bad things bother you -- they do 
    nothing but take away your joy and content.</span>
  <p><span>Tynan&#39;s &#39;not caring about food&#39; is really just his 
    observation that not having fancy meals will not decrease his contentedness. 
    Life events can impact us without impacting our attitudes towards our daily 
    lives and belongings.</span>
  <p><span>&quot;appreciate everything, need nothing&quot;</span>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Achieve everything you can</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><span> Be content with what you have now : )</span>
  </ul>
