   <h1>Emacs</h1>
   <p><span>Emacs is a fully-featured programming environment.</span>
   <p><span>It&#39;s often (or most commonly) referred to as a text editor, but this 
     isn&#39;t the case. Other editors are designed to offer first-class interfaces 
     for configuring keyboard shortcuts, text configurations, etc.</span>
   <p><span>However, emacslisp is structured not to be used as an editor 
     configuration with some additional logic capabilities, but rather as a 
     fully-featured programming language with proper language facilities.</span>
   <p><span>Emacs is my desktop environment. </span><span> was my window manaager, 
     elfeed is my RSS reader, mu4e is my email client and so forth. The one program 
     that does not have a proper Emacs interface is the web browser, so I use Firefox 
     (and web apps) for most other tools.</span>
   <p><span>This isn&#39;t to cause myself undue pain. It reduces context switching 
     between the keyboard shortcuts of many programs and their keybindings, and 
     allows time tracking, task tracking and information management (all fractured, 
     often difficult concepts) to be managed by </span><span> entirely within Emacs. 
     This tight integration allows me to take notes and track time without having to 
     switch contexts to other programs with other user interfaces.</span>
   <p><span>^ I don&#39;t really stick to this anymore, because emacs is honestly not 
     slow and performant. It&#39;s much better to treat Emacs as a text editor and 
     have other purpose built programs. Though there is a future where all text 
     editing configuration is orthogonal to programs and handled independently, it is 
     far from here yet.</span>
