    <section>
     <h3>Design</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Motion Design :: Text in motion carefully chose to make text readable 
        in videos and other animations.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span> This text isn&#39;t visible all the time; rather, it&#39;s moving 
       quickly and likely flashes past during a video.</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Variable Fonts :: One or more axes that provide variation between 
        different extremes of typeface design.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span> These fonts allow for finer control over the design as it changes across 
       the design space!</span>
     <p><span> A font can often be installed as regular, bold or both, and extended 
       designs are expressed nicely.</span>
     <p><span> Formally, this is a specification that allows for multiple fonts to be 
       packaged in a single file.</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> typeface :: A particular design of type. A single group of fonts; a set 
        of fonts in the same style, or &#39;font family&#39;.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> font :: An instance of a typeface; a single weight of style within a 
        typeface family.</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Type</h3>

      <li><span> baseline :: The line on which type sits.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> height :: THe distance from baseline to the top of the lowercase 
        letters, disregarding tall letters such as h.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> cap height :: The distance between a capital letter and baseline.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> ascenders :: The stem above lowercase letters that extends above the 
        alloted height.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> descenders :: Letters that extend below the baseline.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> stem :: The main stroke of the letter (usually vertical).</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> tail :: Descending, decorative stroke on letters such as y and q.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> serif :: The flair extending off of the edge of letters.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span> Defines a &#39;font family&#39; (serif vs sans serif).</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> counter :: The enclosed space within letters like o and g.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> ear :: The small extension on lower half of the letter g.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> terminal :: The end of a stroke without a serif.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> aperture :: Partially closed negative space in characters like c, s, 
        and n. This is always rounded.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> bowl :: The curved part of the character enclosing the circular or 
        curved parts of letters.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span> This occurs in letters like o, d and b.</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> kerning :: Adjusting the space between individual characters.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> tracking :: The spacing of a group of characters.</span>
     </ul>

     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Leading :: Vertical line spacing. generating sufficient space between 
        lines to make it readable</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Ligatures :: Fusing characters that are next to one another that look 
        very similar.</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span> These characters may look awkward when next to one another if they 
       aren&#39;t fused.</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Hyphenation :: Breaking a word across a line and separating it with a 
        dash; a technique typically used to prevent rag problems.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> hyphen :: short dash &#39;-&#39;. used to divide words that break at 
        the end of the line or to connect parts of co mpound words such as 
        &#39;ill-fated&#39;. these are used to represent relationships between 
        individuals rather th an separating them.En-dash : slightly longer hthan the 
        hyphe. used to indicate a range of values, such as a span of time or numerical 
        quantities. sometimes the em-dash is used instead of the en-dash for aesthetic 
        reasons, or a sm all amount of space is added befoer or after the dash for 
        artistic purposes.Em-dash : longer than that!the em-dash is typically used to 
        indicate a break in thought, and is normally followed with and preceded by 
        space. It can be used to describe a thought within a sentence as well -- case in 
        point!grid : guide by which graphic designers can organize, copy and add images 
        in a flexible way while making the concepts easy to absorb and understand.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Rag :: The uneven vertical edge of a block of type -- most commonly the 
        right-hand edge. if the rag is not clean, it can be very distracting to the eye; 
        this can be fixed by reworking the line breaks or by editing a copy.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Widow :: A single word or short line left at the end of a column. This 
        is considered bad typography.</span>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Orphan :: A line exists at the top of the following column!</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span> This can be fixed just like the rag, by reworking the line breaks or 
       editing the copy to remove these typography misdeeds.</span>
    </section>

   <section>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> printing press :: Used a font based on blackletter, similar ot the font 
       traditionally used</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> with handwritten material. This wasn&#39;t good for printing.</span>
    <p><span> Roman type was created to solve this problem. First, Jenson, but the 
      most</span>
    <p><span> recognizable roman font is Cambria.</span>

     <h3>Italics</h3>
     <p><span>created to save space and money when printing books and long form</span>
     <p><span>texts.paved road for old style, transitional style and modern styles of 
       typing.</span>

     <h3>Caslon</h3>
     <p><span>created &#39;old style&#39; or &#39;Antiqua&#39; of type : old style 
       typefaces have</span>
     <p><span>thick serifs, low contrast. these are typically created from 1470 to 
       1600.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Transitional typefaces</h3>
     <p><span>thin serifs with high contrasts between these types.</span>
     <p><span>Baskerville is one such font (which was created as an improvement to the 
       caslon typeface!</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Modern style</h3>
     <p><span>very thin serifs with extreme contrast between strokes. created</span>
     <p><span>to reject traditional styles, annoyed with typefaces based on 
       handwriting!</span>
     <p><span>Modern style initiated by Firmin Didot and Giambatista Bodoni ; Firmin 
       Didot</span>
     <p><span>created modern style classification type, Didot, followed by the Bodoni</span>

     <p><span>sans serif typefaces -- no projecting featues at the end of</span>
     <p><span>strokes! Helvetica : known as the favorite typeface, one of the most 
       populat.</span>
     <p><span>variations on this include slab serifs and gemoetric sans. slab : 
       magazines,</span>

    <h2>Embellishments</h2>
    <p><span>indents: indenting</span>
    <p><span>the first line of every paragraph has always been a convention -- to 
      create</span>
    <p><span>a visual separation between paragraphsCreative ieaas : extreme indent, 
      outdent.</span>
    <p><span>with room and for a cleaner, more open look, separate paragraph s with an</span>
    <p><span>extra line rather than using tab indentation at all!arabesques :; graphic</span>
    <p><span>ordaments and embellishments -- from simple geometric designs to ornate</span>
    <p><span>configurations. many are often digital recreations of historic designs. 
      they</span>
    <p><span>have many uses - have fun with them</span>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Classifying Type</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>Serif</h3>
     <p><span>Traditional typefaces with feet or arms hanging off of the end of letter 
       strokes, adding a thick or thin look to the letter.</span>
     <p><span>These are considered the easiest fonts to read.</span>
     <p><span>Serif fonts are &#39;fancy&#39; fonts -- they all have embellishments. 
       Times New Roman, a serif font, is the most used font as the most common font 
       found in newspapers.</span>
     <ul>
      <li><span> Examples :: baskerville, clarendon, garamond, georgia, trajan</span>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Sans-Serif</h3>
     <p><span> Fonts without serifs and having an overall more even stroke weight. 
       clean, modern, minima list</span>
     <p><span> - Examples :: arial, futura, impact, myriad, tahoma</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Decorative</h3>
     <p><span>Fonts typically used only for attention-grabbing headlines.</span>
     <p><span>Only one decorative font should be used, and not as the body font!</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Script</h3>
     <p><span>Script fonts are intended to mimic handwriting, so the letters often 
       touch one another.</span>
     <p><span>These fonts should never be used with all-caps.</span>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Dingbats</h3>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <section>
     <h3>Font Size</h3>
     <p><span>On computers, 72 pt. font corresponds to one inch on paper.</span>
     <p><span>Two different font sizes at the same point can correspond to different 
       physical sizes, and correct size does depend on use.</span>

     <h3>Spacing</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><span> character and word spacing, kerning, -- space between each character or 
        letter, adjusted to create plea sing look</span>
     </ul>
     <p><span>tracking, -- adjustment of word spacing, similar to kerning but refers to 
       space between words rather than characters</span>
     <p><span>line spacing, leading -- amount of space between lines of type -- larger 
       the type, the more leading neede d!</span>
     <p><span>, paragraph spacing, alignment, -- alignment : text flowing on a page. 
       center, left, right etc. justifie d : straight edge on boht sides!</span>
     <p><span>line breaks and rag,</span>
     <p><span>hyphens, -- don&#39;t have more than two hyphenations in a row, don&#39;t 
       have too many hyphenated lines in a si ngle paragraph, ensure the rag checks 
       out, make sure that justified text looks natural</span>
     <p><span>widows and orphans -- paragraph spacing -- at end: widow; at top of 
       following;</span>
     <p><span>orphan! do not leave these distracting shapes! edit the copy to remove 
       them.</span>
     <p><span>never use bold serif type, apparently? john cane is very against it.</span>
