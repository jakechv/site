    <h2>convenience store woman</h2>
    <p><span>i love the flow and repetition of this book. the way the old woman with 
      the cane is mentioned three times before. taking the piss is an interesting 
      phrase, and i didnt particularly like the overdescriptive introduction, but i 
      loved the arc back to normalcy that the book provided - the convenience store 
      was right, and sometimes we must trend back to comfort, even if comfort is a 
      different convenience store in a different place. i&#39;m glad those cute 
      literary tricks were ported through the translation but given some passages that 
      seem kind of strange i sense there are many more in the original japanese - 
      there seems to be some interesting playing with names, and addressing people in 
      different ways in different contexts, that doesn&#39;t come through because we 
      don&#39;t have the robust honorific system of Japan.</span>
    <p><span>i wasn&#39;t a fan of the Shiraha character and feel that a more mixed 
      influence rather than one decidedly negative may have been helpful to propel the 
      story forwarda, because denying things that were positive influences as well for 
      the convenience store, perhaps, may have made the return to normalcy more 
      impactful, as we see that her experience with Shiraha is decidedly negative. 
      phrases like taking the piss are interesting, as well as the choice to translate 
      greetings in some places but use only a phonetic translation in others. i love 
      the description of *feeling* the convenience store, feeling at home, trying to 
      accommodate others to fit in, using food as a resource rather than a temptation, 
      and developing as a result from influences around us. some</span>
    <p><span>key learnings (lmfao): i disagree with &#39;not betraying your 
      nature&#39; philosophy and with &#39;conforming to society&#39;, the third path 
      being doing whatever you want to do and being really really good at it and 
      fucking around until you win basically, because pursuing that passion and the 
      feeling of this is what you are meant to do is so much more important than 
      anything else, and miss fukuhara realizes this. there&#39;s also a sense to not 
      tightly curate your influences but to be constantly aware of them - things like 
      adopting mannerisms from those around you - because these are inevitable, so 
      absorbing good works with good influences is so so important.</span>

    <h2>uzumaki, gyo</h2>
    <p><span>just finished uzumaki and gyo. brilliant, haunting stories, but very 
      simple as well.</span>

    <h2>chainsaw man</h2>
    <p><span>lovely combination of critical humor, great art, action and storytelling. 
      precursor attempts some of the same things but gets them wrong: masks kind of 
      flat. naked religious criticism in a dystopian action story that doesn&#39;t 
      entirely add up, and whrrein some plot points sre just dropped entirely or 
      obfuscated away into nothing</span>
