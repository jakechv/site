    <h2>Tools for Better Thinking</h2>
    <p>
    <p><span>The most underrated problem solving tool is to type out and explain your</span>
    <p><span>thought process.</span>
    <p><span>Start writing down questions to ask others; as you explain what you have</span>
    <p><span>tried, you will begin to realize that there are more things left to try 
      --</span>
    <p><span>some of which being potential solutions.</span>
    <p><span>Type your question into StackOverflow to submit; you&#39;ll be fearful of 
      asking</span>
    <p><span>the question.</span>
    <p><span>Rank factors; always express factors as positive attributes. After 
      generating</span>
    <p><span>the table, the longest continuous line of check marks for each factor</span>
    <p><span>determines the choice (though this can be gamed...)</span>
    <p><span>State charts: easy to reason about state changes without the explosion of</span>
    <p><span>state machines. These are hierarchical state machines, in a sense.</span>
    <p><span>The Inversion Methods: The solution to many hard problems can be 
      clarified by</span>
    <p><span>re-expressing them in inverse form.</span>
    <p><span>Crossline: structure your thoughts as you type and make cross-references.</span>

    <p><span>article</span>
    <p><span>THe modern web is painful. Interfacing with js and node results in 
      conflitts</span>
    <p><span>between es and js versions, node incompatibilities, differnet import 
      syntax</span>
    <p><span>in different circumstances, etc. it&#39;s painful. How do you import with 
      node?</span>
    <p><span>without node? &lt;script&gt; tag or not to script? Where did the node 
      modules go?</span>
    <p><span>This is a good rant of questions and things to feature on the wbesite</span>

      anxiety-in-product-development</span>
    <p><span>anxiety can emerge easily from stress, resulting in anger, frustration 
      and</span>
    <p><span>other unhealthy forms of exerting such stress. this impacts other people,</span>
    <p><span>organizations and processes as well. </span>
    <p><span>we have fear driven development : a concrete idea encouraging us to avoid</span>
    <p><span>certain practices depending upon the specific approach</span>
    <p><span>play to win, don&#39;t play not to lose; developing a unique selling 
      proposition</span>
    <p><span>means that you are no longer fighting with others, but rather striving to</span>
    <p><span>come out ahead</span>
    <p><span>awareness of such anxiety is the first step to take. with this awareness</span>
    <p><span>comes conscious decision making, and with such decisions come wiser 
      product</span>
    <p><span>crafting and, in the end, better, more creative work</span>

      --</span>
    <p><span>to trust platforms, we must see how each part is produced from source, 
      but we</span>
    <p><span>do not have access to the source of compiled code when we run it against 
      the</span>

       acceptable</span>
     <p><span>opinion at the time</span>

     <p><span>desires of others and pursue their ideas</span>
     <p><span>mimetic theory of conflict :: similar = fight</span>
