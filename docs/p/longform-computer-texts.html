  <p><span>Title: Long-form Texts on Interesting Details of Computers</span>
  <p><span>Date: Wed, 15 Apr 2020 18:00:00 -0400</span>

  <p><span>It seems especially recently I’ve come across more and more long-form 
    texts</span>
  <p><span>(think: hour-long blog posts; free books; series of posts). I especially 
    like</span>
  <p><span>the ones that go into the very fine details of some niche topic and maybe 
    also</span>
  <p><span>ramble a bit about completely unrelated but highly entertaining asides. 
    And</span>
  <p><span>while I will probably never have enough time to read them all, I decided 
    to at</span>
  <p><span>least collect some of them here for future reference. I’ll do my best to 
    add</span>
  <p><span>summaries, and to update this list semi-regularly.</span>

  <p><span>“Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists[19]” by Alexis 
    Beingessner</span>
  <p><span>(~180 pages; archived[20])</span>
  <p><span>The premise of this book is that writing a linked list is a beginner’s 
    exercise</span>
  <p><span>in C but quite difficult to get right in Rust. So it takes that as an</span>
  <p><span>opportunity to do just what the title says: It teaches you Rust by 
    implementing</span>
  <p><span>a linked list type in Rust, in five (as of April 2020) different ways.</span>
  <p><span>Niches: data structures; linked lists; rust; smart pointers</span>
  <p><span>Last update I saw: 2019-03-21</span>
  <p><span>“Programming Algorithms[21]” by Vsevolod Domkin</span>
  <p><span>(~300 pages; archived[22])</span>
  <p><span>Book covering a lot of different data structures and algorithms. “Its aim 
    is to</span>
  <p><span>systematically explain how to write efficient programs and, also, the 
    approaches</span>
  <p><span>and tools for determining why the program isn’t efficient enough.”</span>
  <p><span>Niches: data structures; algorithms; lisp</span>
  <p><span>Last update I saw: 2020-04-16</span>
  <p><span>“Aspects of Rust” by multiple people</span>
  <p><span>Several stand-alone posts by various people whose only connection is that 
    they</span>
  <p><span>cover nice aspects of Rust.</span>
  <p><span>Niches: rust</span>

    blanks.</span>

  <p><span> Working with strings in Rust[35] (archived[36])</span>
