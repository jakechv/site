   <h2>Writing a Git Commit Message</h2>
   <p><span></span><a href=\"https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\">Article 
     Reference</a><span></span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Concise and consistent length and form</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Communicate clear context about a change to fellow developers.</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span> Ensure that other developers understand *why* a change was made.</span>
   <section>
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Separate subject from body with a blank line</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> if the body is to be used.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Limit subject line to 50 characters</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Capitalize subject line</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Do not end with period</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Use imperative mood; I &#39;do&#39; this.</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> Rationale: If applied, the commit will change these aspects of the code.</span>
    <p><span> Git&#39;s own built-in conventions use this form.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Wrap at 72 characters</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Use the body to explain &#39;what&#39; and &#39;why&#39; as necessary</span>
    </ul>

   <h2>Repositories</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><span> GitHub :: I use this; Microsoft is bad but the community is good</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Sourcehut :: Minimal free software repository. I would use this if the 
      developer weren&#39;t an egotistical BDFL.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Gitea :: Open source git repository; self host it</span>
   </ul>

   <h2>Organization Thoughts</h2>
   <p><span>github organization:</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> one repo per course - as most courses require partner work</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span>= repo for coding challenge practice problems</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> managing research notes: ??? i am thinking a single org file for all of 
      this</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> - that is, an org file in each project for the research notes 
      pertaining to that project,</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> - and anotherorg file for misc. research ?? i will have to see how my 
      research is used</span>
   </ul>

   <h2>Rewriting</h2>
   <p><span>It&#39;s a good idea to reformat commits to make them more readable.</span>
   <pre><code class=language-sh>git reset HEAD~${number of commits to go back}
</code></pre>

   <h2>Tricks</h2>
   <p><span>
     http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/how_to_publish_git_repos_that_cannot_be_republished_to_github/
      :: cheeky way to abuse DMCA to avoid GitHub using your Git repos</span>
   <p><span>
     https://sourcehut.org/blog/2020-10-29-how-mailing-lists-prevent-censorship/ 
     using the mailing list model over the built-in issue model, and how this 
     naturally federated and local first procedure is superior to github&#39;s 
     standard issue approach</span>
   <p><span>https://sagegerard.com/git-debugging.html: use git bisect while 
     referencing maintainers of specific parts of code to narrow down to the code you 
     should care about, then ask the maintainers about it - while putting in a 
     minimum of effort.</span>
   <p><span>https://labs.consol.de/development/git/2017/02/22/gitignore.html using 
     .gitignore the right way</span>

    <h3>Patch previous commits with rebases</h3>
    <p><span>
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9103396/how-do-i-edit-a-previous-git-commit</span>
    <p><span>If you need to change commit history:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Make another commit to make the change</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Rebase starting at the commit you want to change</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Squash the new commit with the old one in the history</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Remove the second commit message (or merge it...)</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span>This did change the commit time for my latest commit, which is something 
      to watch out for.</span>

   <h2>Worktrees</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><span> A git repository can have multiple working trees - allowing you to 
      check out more than one workspace at a time!</span>
   </ul>
   <p><span> + Among other things, this allows you to work on multiple branches at 
     once without having multiple copies of the file, and maps git branches or tags 
     to other directories on your system. Use it to check on different efforts on 
     projects without messing up your current editing environment - to look at code 
     from other branches locally and simultaneously, for example!</span>
   <ul>
    <li><span> `git worktree add $PATH` :: Adds a new branch with a name associated 
      with the final component of $PATH. `git worktree remove` and `git worktree 
      prune` both allow you to cut off external worktrees.</span>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><span> Flow example: latest develop, latest branch of work, and a third for 
      reviewing pull requests and/or the work from other developers.</span>
   </ul>
