    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p><span>Websites should be minimal.</span>
    <p><span>There is no reason to download five megabytes of Javascript to 
      communicate</span>
    <p><span>my hiring credentials. I shouldn&#39;t have to wade through frameworks 
      and dark</span>
    <p><span>patterns to read a blog post!</span>
    <p><span>I am taking a reductionist approach to web design by:</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Limiting the number of lines of Javascript.</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> Javascript consumes unnecessary resources and can distract from 
      information</span>
    <p><span> presented; as such, Javascript should serve only to enhance current 
      content.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Limiting the number of colors on the site, shifting focus to central 
       components.</span>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li><span> Reducing the overall complexity of the project.</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> You can only truly understand a machine if you can remove every piece</span>
    <p><span> you don&#39;t need. If every piece is necessary for communicating the 
      information,</span>
    <p><span> it&#39;s all the end user should need to see.</span>
    <p><span>Aesthetics aside, focusing on minimizing web development allows the 
      millions of</span>
    <p><span>people worldwide with slow connections to access resources and 
      information.</span>
    <p><span>Using a simple subset of CSS and Javascript, too, enables older browsers 
      and</span>
    <p><span>hardware to sufficiently load websites.</span>
    <p><span>The web doesn&#39;t have to be so hostile or expensive to run.</span>
    <p><span>Focus on boiling it down to its essentials.</span>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span>, one I stumbled upon only because he shares</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> a last name with Northeastern&#39;s Computer Science college, has</span>
    <p><span> an astoundingly minimal yet well-designed site. It&#39;s easy to 
      navigate</span>
    <p><span> and has no distractions from the site&#39;s objective.</span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span> are a creative duo comprised of Rekka Bellum and</span>
    </ul>
    <p><span> </span><span>; they&#39;ve inspired me to move towards using</span>
    <p><span> minimal, accessible tooling, and have a fantastic design language</span>
    <p><span> present throughout all of their work. </span>
    <ul>
     <li><span> </span><span>, a design consultancy with a lot of great work. They have 
       lots of mockups and designs to reference.</span>
