This is the index of my personal website found [[https://jake.isnt.online][here]].

* Why JS?
Javascript is the language of the internet. 
Code should run on the client, on the server, at build time, and anywhere in between.
This infrastructure facilitates that.

* Running
Dependencies are managed with Nix. Install `nix` and `direnv`. Open the folder in your system of choice, and all dependencies will install.

The flake has one command: `site`. The CLI will tell you what you can do with it :  )
