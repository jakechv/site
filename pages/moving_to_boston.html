Lots of cool local music and basement house shows and that kind of thing! If you're interested I can send you my apartment from last year lol, old but good price for the (perfect imo) location</li><li>Unless you're right next to Harvard/MIT campus, don't worry about living near undergrads in Cambridge; most people live on campus or in. Grad students are scattered throughout cambridge/somerville so there is really no avoiding them lol</li><li>South end apartments all look really cool and area is super walkable, but it doesn't feel very 'mixed use' - you'll end up walking into back bay / the city proper for things to do. If you want to optimize for walking to work, south end; if you want to live near good businesses and commute go t cambridge/somervilI put cambrigeport as #1 because it's centrally located - bridges to everywhere in boston, close to red line near the city. it's super quiet and you're still ~10-15 min walk from lots of good businesses in cambridge. davis square area #2, it's annoying how far it is from the city (expect at 30-45 mins to financial district unless they improve the T lol) but has the best local businesses imo of any area in boston, very quiet and walkable. south end #3 for reasons stated, cambridge is just more fun to hang out in in early-mid 20s imo than boston</li></ul><p>seaport also exists and will be easiest place to find apartment but you will feel like a clone</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-04-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/4822f98f357072debbb6a6d5414172df33830d8b//home/jake/wiki/pages/moving_to_boston.md">4822f98f</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
