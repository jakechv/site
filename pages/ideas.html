How fast can we ship across NYC? Howfast do people want to ship? Ideal pace is slower than</p><p>UX? either 'fun' -we enjoy giving things to our friends! - or business -most efifcient way to get things from A to B, no questions asked.</p><h1 id="doc-viewer">doc viewer</h1><p>tool able to view just a subset of a webpage: i.e. for an article onlyview the text itself, the way the author intended, as the main body,separating it from the rest of the content.</p><h1 id="incredibly-painful-experience-onboarding-and-settuing-up-react-etc">incredibly painful experience onboarding and settuing up react etc.</h1><p>it does not have to be this way. concretely: what's github? what'svscode? how do i open, view and edit files? what's the differencebetween github, github desktop, vscode, react native? what is nodejs forand what does it let us do?</p><h1 id="some-pitches-from-email">some pitches from email</h1><p>these are visible in the \`ideas\` top level folder. i would like abetter way to track them; i'll definitely flesh them out in the wiki,but i really like being able to send email to an address to sketch themout. i would prefer sketching them out on paepr and just sending animage in, but honestly i want this idea period to support whatevermedium is most flexible - i just have to make sure the whole idea isrecorded and written down ads fast as possible.</p><h1 id="redfin-art">redfin art</h1><p>house showcase super interesting idea; get to know someone's life basedon the house they left behind the house on bluefin, or redfin, road</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//pages/ideas.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
