Start writing down questions to ask others; as you explain whatyou have tried, you will begin to realize that there are more thingsleft to try – some of which being potential solutions.</p><p>Type your question into StackOverflow to submit; you'll be fearful ofasking the question.</p><p>Rank factors; always express factors as positive attributes. Aftergenerating the table, the longest continuous line of check marks foreach factor determines the choice (though this can be gamed…) Statecharts: easy to reason about state changes without the explosion ofstate machines. These are hierarchical state machines, in a sense. TheInversion Methods: The solution to many hard problems can be clarifiedby re-expressing them in inverse form.
