A seminal cyberpunk fantasy with animation thatstill feels like it's from the future. There's no need for expositionbecause the story tells itself.</p><h2 id="goodfellas">Goodfellas</h2><p>Great narrative – clearly inspired movies like the wolf of wall streetans catch me if you can, among others.</p><h2 id="monty-python-and-the-holy-grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</h2><h2 id="taxi-driver">Taxi Driver</h2><h2 id="pineapple-express">Pineapple Express</h2><p>Stupid 'comedy' movie, no depth involved</p><h2 id="office-space">Office Space</h2><p>Great movie, struck a bit close to home… definitely empathized with themain characters (aside from the hacking part).</p><h2 id="american-psycho">American Psycho</h2><p>A bit scary that Bateman has taste so similar to mine… except for thepsychopathic killer thing. Love his interior decor!
