Without a good namethe project will fail.</p><h1 id="reddit-tree-navigation">Reddit Tree Navigation</h1><p>Remember Prezi? You could click on different bubbles to navigate througha presentation nonlinearly, or could navigate it linearly with forwardand backwards arrow keys.</p><p>This has a lot of potential! Let's try it with Reddit threads. <a href="https://github.com/ssorallen/react-reddit-client">Anexample client to getstarted</a></p><h2 id="ux">UX</h2><p>Visiting a reddit post and prefixing it with the reddit tree website'sURL opens a window with the post's contents at the top of the webpage.Below this, there are lots of bubbles pseudorandomly scatteredthroughout the page. Their sizes are by default weighted by the numberof upvotes on the comment, but they can be arranged by number ofcomments in the thread branching from the comment or some other metrics(TBD).</p><p>Each bubble has the username, number of upvotes, and the prefix of thecomment. They may have smaller bubbles visible to demonstrate the nextlayer of comments in the tree.</p><p>Clicking on one of these bubbles does one of two things (not sure yet):</p><ul><li>Moves the bubble to the top right of the screen</li><li>Replaces the text of the reddit post with that of the comment opened</li></ul><p>Either way, the user now has access to a back button to go 'back up' inthe tree (we define clicking on a bubble as 'going down' the tree), andthey also can see all of the comments descended from the currently opencomment as first-class bubbles.</p><p>Each of these pages will also havte a bubble with a plus sign on it inthe bottom right of the page; clicking this opens a bubble that fillsmost of the screen, with the comment or post you're commenting onfeatured as a smaller bubble above it (perhaps it's visible as asemicircle under this bubble?). You can then make a reddit comment usingthe usual reddit facilities for this.</p><h2 id="production">Production</h2><h3 id="mvp">MVP</h3><ul><li>Visit a specific url on the reddit tree view website to open a redditthread.</li><li>View the post and each comment in a bubble.</li><li>Click a bubble to view the next level of comments.</li></ul><h3 id="enhanced-ux">Enhanced UX</h3><ul><li>Tree view can be accessed by prefixing a reddit URL thread with ourURL.</li><li>Post bubbles are sized proportionally to their number of upvotes orsome other ranking metric. You can see smaller bubbles around themthat provide an estimate of the number of comments in their assoc.thread.</li></ul><h3 id="usable-for-reddit">Usable for Reddit</h3><ul><li>The user can log in and make comments themselves.</li></ul><h3 id="complete-product">Complete Product</h3><p>Rather than providing alternate views to individual threads, the programcan instead act as its own reddit client.</p><p>The main page of the site functions just like Reddit's home page, onlywith bubbles for each subreddit. The bubbles are weighted proportionalto the number of new posts, popularity of those posts or some othermetric.</p><p>When clicking on one of these subreddit bubbles, you open a secondarybubble view that showcases each post in the subreddit. A UI is providedto make new posts in the subreddit from this page.</p><p>Clicking on an individual posts opens the fleshed out idea above,providing an alternative navigational experience for all of reddit.</p><h1 id="version-control-for-music">Version Control for Music</h1><p>Live coding is a good idea, but it's meant to be 'played'; currentsolutions for persisting livecoding information require recording, whichcompresses all of the structural information associated with the music,or meticulously copying and pasting code then saving it all.</p><p>We can do better!</p><p>A 'recording' mode for a live coding environment could be implemented.</p><p>To start the recording mode, a new branch is created. Every time thefile is updated and re-run, it's recorded as a git commit in a project'scommit history. The commit message has notation demonstrating how long acertain commit was played (time from start of recording to first commitor from the last commit to the current one).</p><p>When done recording, you can switch back to the main branch. The newbranches are identified by a particular notation in the branch name todemonstrate that they were automatically created.</p><p>These recordings can be:</p><ul><li>Played back. A menu is exposed to 'play' each of the created branches.When a branch is played, its first commit is run through the musicinterpreter for a specified amount of time, then the new commit ischecked out and re-run; this is identical to a user manually editingthe file and updating the played music, and tracks will only update ifthe code has been changed for them.</li><li>Exported: this can be done in the same way tracks are played back.</li><li>Converted to linear tracks. You can 'export' a branch to a lineararrangement to make it easier to edit and turn into a complete songwithout having to record it! This process generates the appropriatepauses in between the different parts of the music and loops to ensurethat the different segments of the track are run at the right time andin the right order. This allows artists to take live coding projectsthat have been performed. convert them into full-fledged tracks, andexport them without having to perform them.</li></ul><h1 id="done-spell-check-hook"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Spell Check Hook</h1><p>I hate improper spelling or formatting. A linter that checks for properspelling in a project with git hooks! You won't be able to commit toyour projecct until you fix those spelling errors.</p><p>This is pretty easy with husky and eslint-plugin-spellcheck â€“ and it's apain to use. Make this a separate git repo but do not explore thisfurther.</p><h1 id="github-readme-information-generators">GitHub README Information Generators</h1><p>These are tools dynamically queried by README files that showinformation about specific projects. They're lightweight and easilyhosted. <a href="https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats">https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats</a> is a goodplace to start for learning how to make one such banner.</p><p>Look into dynamically configuring and formatting text via a specific webquery. Perhaps a server can be made to accept arbitrary html/css andoutput an image with this information?</p><p>I'll also need a tool for converting such a file into a URL-compatibleversion, see<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1547899/which-characters-make-a-url-invalid#1547940">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1547899/which-characters-make-a-url-invalid#1547940</a>.</p><h1 id="obscure-programming-languages-web-app">Obscure programming languages web app</h1><ul><li>build it in cljs (clojurescript)</li><li>provide interpreters for all of the silly obscure programminglanguages i can</li><li><p>make it super easy for people new to the project to add and contributemore languages</p><ul><li>support parsing BNF grammars and converting them into interpretersin the code as a sort of codegen, as a lot of the languages arespecified using BNF</li></ul></li><li>reference: that one wiki. idea is to provide reference implementationsfor the reasonable ones to try out!</li></ul><h1 id="etc">ETC</h1><p>configure keybindings for multiple programs at once 'compile' to assigncomprehensive keybindings to all utilities single point of controlfriendly, easy to use configuration language that can 'target' differentthings</p><p>web search from terminal, and from rofi or something that just comes upthat i can type into</p><p>for projectional editing: provide clear auditory indications ofdifferent program behaviors to alarm us. eg wiring up jenkins tounsuccessful deployments on different pipelines, different sounds fordifferent themes. pluggable sound system with insertable sound effects;able to hear two events occuring at identical intervals but it isdifficult to see this in terms of time stamps!</p><h1 id="working-on-linux">working on linux</h1><p>xournal for annotating pdf obs sdutio for webcam video audacity forautio editing video editing with openshot?

It allows users to easily browse the differentsample applications â€“ potentially as inner HTML frames, but they couldbe in amy form. Users should have access to a preview of the experimentsin some way.</p><p>Regardless of presentation, the website should contain a folder of gitsubmodules â€“ each corresponding to one of the 'experiments'. Theseexperiments are added to the final static site as links when the websiteis uploaded as part of a CI action or similar, though this can initiallybe done manually. Each submodule should display a website and shouldhost itself in a subdirectory of 'experiments'.</p><h1 id="next-portfolio">NEXT Portfolio</h1><p>I've been thinking that my single page introduction isn't quite enoughfor employers, and that it might be good to add a portfolio withwriteups to document each of my projects.</p><p>Maybe I could do this in a cool, nonlinear way, like SSENSE does orsimilar to how the minimal photography websites approach things. Thinkabout how I can write about my projects and include them in a portfolio.</p><p>Ideally I link the repositories and the description for the project ispulled from the README of each repository so I don't have to do anyadditional writing. These READMEs should already include appropriatescreenshots, and whatever tool configures the portfolio website shouldbe able to render these. (It could also take the GitHub summary line andmake that the headline for the project!)</p><p>Perhaps 'experiments' and 'portfolio' are one and the same; perhaps'experiments' is completely abstract while 'portfolio' is concrete andprofessional.
