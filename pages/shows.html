This includes anime.</p><p>Feels like this sort of system - for rating and reviewing things -should have some sort of bespoke file convention allocated for it. Whatshould that look like? Should I just post reviews on external sites?</p><h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1><p>breaking bad the wire fargo</p><h1 id="reviews">Reviews</h1><h2 id="queens-gambit">Queen's Gambit</h2><p>Beautifully done 1950's woman empowerment - but not about woman - geniuscharacter develops into a star and navigates relationships with apragmatic view of the world but desparate one of the past.</p><h2 id="flcl">FLCL</h2><p>aka Fooly Cooly 2000s anime; I love the soundtrack but the plot isnonsensical or entirely absent.</p><h2 id="neon-genesis-evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</h2><p>Absolutely beatiful series. Killer opening theme that doesn't fit theshow at all. The pacing and visuals are artful; entirely different fromany comparable series. that ending really sucked though</p><h2 id="fma-brotherhood">FMA Brotherhood</h2><p>True to the manga but skips all of the fluff - somehow improves on thebest moments. the retrospective did them some huge favors, and they wereable to perfect already one of the best manga out there</p><h2 id="death-note">Death Note</h2><p>As expected, this is an incredible series. The third arc (could beconsidered the second arc) notably trails off in quality relative to thesecond arc or the first segment of the series as characters begin tolose dimension – though some of the characters have to develop flaws tosome degree as the series continues or there wouldn't be any resolution.</p><h2 id="erased">Erased</h2><p>Poetic, simple series about someone who's hit a dead end making theright decisions and changing his life. All of the characters areincredibly fleshed out, and the depiction of trauma is almost poetic –all of them, in one way or another, garner sympathy from the watcher andyou become invested in just 12 episodes. Not a moment is wasted, either;the series starts and resolves quickly and all of the plot points arecleanly tied together.</p><h2 id="steinsgate">Steins;Gate</h2><p>This started incredibly slow and I didn't have the patience to continuewatching. The characters didn't feel comprehensive and didn't have muchdepth to them; the same corny anime jokes were made so many times withinthe first few episodes, and actual plot elements were few and farbetween.</p><h2 id="parasyte">Parasyte</h2><p>The series was very engaging and I loved the visuals. Wasn't the biggestfan of how it ended, or of the explicit narration of the 'meaning' ofthe series that consumed most of the last episode, as this was allimplied throughout the show and could have been left that way. I'll bereading the manga : )</p><h2 id="the-great-pretender">The Great Pretender</h2><p>Satisfying story. A bit predictable/implausible at the end and draggedon quite a bit, but it was a fun watch. Super high quality production asanticipated!</p><h2 id="cowboy-bebop">Cowboy Bebop</h2><p>In progress - find a good place to stream this (watched through ep 5)</p><h2 id="trigun">Trigun</h2><p>In progress - find a good place to stream this (watched through ep 5)</p><h2 id="rezero">RE:Zero</h2><h2 id="master-of-none-s3">master of none s3</h2><p>beautiful series about a breakup of a lesbian relationship. each playsinteresting roles in the relationship. some of the fights don't feelreal, they feel irrational, especially as instigated by a 'chemistryphd' of a character. beautiful cinematography snd a sweet ending, thoughthe conflict driving the narrative was honestly not very believable tome. cool/interesting that so many characters in clinical roles were pocas well.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//pages/shows.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
