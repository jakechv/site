regardless, main characters are genuinelycompelling, enough for me to spend lots of time on the series</p><h2 id="fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas">fear and loathing in las vegas</h2><p><a href="id:c1fdd31a-1ba0-4631-8bb3-38e6eab4a807">Movies</a> unlike the book, ireally didn't find this story compelling - a bit more of an unelaborateddrugfest than anticipated (where was the emotion from the novel?). cutegimmicks like the wide angle lens and the bugeyes, but i didn't find theactors particularly manic or convincing as described in the novel. lovethe haphazard filming, the stylized colors, the wide angle, close uplens and the paranoid behavior, but i don't think there's any catchingup to the book here</p><h1 id="symptom-vs-bug">symptom vs bug</h1><p><a href="id:9d566115-cfc1-4fec-833e-636e69a4e4fe">Programming Languages</a> fromjogn regehr a bug can have many symptoms, and many bugs can share thesame symptom. often you can patch one symptom of a bug, but the systemicmotivation - the bug itself - remains</p><h1 id="getting-hired-brief-advice">getting hired brief advice</h1><h2 id="asking-on-linkedin">asking on linkedin</h2><p>look at recruiters on LinkedIn for positions you're interested in Hi! ihope you're well!
