"Allenlightened beings that provide salvation teach the Fa that they havebecome enlightened to and make it public to save people." "I haveexpressed all the principles of the Fa from the lowest level to thehighest level of the universe in a very plain and simple language of theordinary people and through Qigong, the lowest form of cultivationpractice. After reading the book for the first time, you will find thatit is teaching people the principles of how to be a good person. If youread it again, you will find that what it states are not the principlesof ordinary people, but it is a book beyond ordinary human knowledge. Ifyou can read it a third time, you will find that it is a book of heaven.If you continue to read it, you will love it so much that you simplycannot let it go of your hands."</p><p>"If you find a Bodhisattva so beautiful, you may develop some evilthoughts. Can this be allowed? Of course it won't be allowed. Thus, youwill have to give up these attachments and the filth as well as badthoughts in ordinary human society."</p><p>claims that there are ordinary people an enlightened beings; people onlyascend to enlightened beings by repeatedly reading his book lol</p><p>classic arguments about current year being the peak of humandegeneration, and similarly immoral, degenerate societies collapsingthroughout history- reading the book will save us from this degeneracy?</p><p>you are molecules with eyes so you can't see. "…you are all in a maze.Then, you cannot see the truth of the universe while being in the maze."</p><p>"The language I used in this book "Zhuan Falun" is not standard becauseusing modern standardized language cannot encompass higher levels andgreater content."</p><p>if someone receives pain and suffering than someone else shouldcorrespondingly lose happiness? "De": ostensibly some name for karma andgetting even with "Fa" in the universe.</p><p>supposedly practitioners are not ordinary people and not only gain theability to give and receive De, but also to block out De.</p><p>"Modern science is unable to see {conflict; De} because it cannot breakthrough this dimension. What kind of dimensional form does our humanrace live in? I am telling everyone that this dimensional layer wheremankind lives is between two kinds of particles. As for particles, thoseof us who have studied physics know that molecules, atoms, nuclei,quarks, and neutrinos are each a layer of particles. They are physicalelements that constitute larger particles. Which layer of particles doesmankind exist in? The largest things that we see with human eyes areplanets, and the smallest things that we can see under the microscopeare molecules. In fact, our mankind just exists in this dimensionallayer between the planets and the molecules. We may find it very vast,very extensive, and incomparably big. I say that modern science is notadvanced. No matter how far a spacecraft can fly, it cannot fly beyondthis physical dimension of ours. However developed a computer is, itcannot match the human brain. Now the human brain is still a mystery.Therefore, the science of mankind is still very shallow."</p><p>yoo the third eye ('Tianmu') to the inner body ('pineal body', 'niwanpalace') too - classic cult hallmark.</p><p>"It is very easy for a practitioner to levitate, which scientistsnowadays cannot explain. In fact, when all the channels of a person’sbody have all been completely opened up, he will be able to levitate."</p><p>"Why do they give an injection to let a person die? They think that heis suffering. However, we think that his suffering is eliminatingkarma."</p><p>Li has some very bad things to say about interracial children… supposesthat Eastern born people are born with balance and that this balance iscorrupted without purity. Yikes!</p><p>This is crazy - the dictionary at the bottom provides lots of incrediblevocabulary too. Fun to reference in the future, perhaps.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-new-cult-lore-just-dropped"><a href="/journals/2021-10-24.html#new-cult-lore-just-dropped">new-cult-lore-just-dropped</a></td></tr></table></div><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2021-10-24.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2021-10-26.html">2021-10-26</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2021-10-23.html">2021-10-23</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></div></div></div></body></html>
