Understanding your feelings rather thanrationalizing them in the context of others (i.e: this is what i wantand they behave that way because they have different values, as opposedto 'they reacted poorly to something i said or did, what did i dowrong'). feelings get a lot of things right, and are early flags forthings you want, don't want, should be or should not be. listen toyourself more!</p><h2 id="0947-agency-resources">09:47 agency resources</h2><p><a href="https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency">https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency</a>early lives in biographies feel the most important! but diminishedagency in childhood seems to deprive too many of us from theexperiences, the advent, the innovations that we could have on our own.it's unclear whether the structure of clubs, robotics competitions, orother ruch tools is healthy or sustainable!
