Show that I have a distinct personal style that I can apply to a variety of circumstances, environments, and genres - from studio portraiture to product photography to landscapes and architecture work. Make sure people can recognize the style and point it back to you, but also that someone could hire you for anything.</li><li>Personal website ++ portfolio. I need a clear way to showcase my work in a way that feels professional.</li><li>Cold email lots of industry photographers asking for advice. We don't know what the goalposts for hiring are until we've reached out and found them out.</li><li>Actively find and enter photo competitions. This will get you noticed by other people - particularly those who care about photography.</li><li>WRITE! If nobody hires you, do your own photojournalism work. Compose essays and put photos together about places to find and follow through with themes. Use collections of 5-10 photos to showcase ideas, developments, and potential exhibitions.** 13:59 reputationit's important to me that my name is associated with diligence where it matters.</li></ul><p>How do I accomplish this?</p><ul><li>Track everything. Everything goes on the calendar or is written down in some system.</li><li>Keep everything and everyone in mind. Everything and everyone is followed up with quickly and consistently.</li><li>Budget time. Dedicate parts of the day to specific tasks and accomplish within those parameters whenever possible. Over-estimate time committments and fill the flex time with five-minute tasks.</li><li>Release consistently. Publish publicly every day in some form, whether through a tweet, Instagram post, tiktok, newsletter, or piece of writing. Prefer 'pushing' to 'polling'; make sure publications are sent directly to others rather than requiring people to poll a site to receive them. This way, other people become accustomed to receiving information and can hold you accountable when you don't stick to a schedule.</li><li>Make today's work an upgrade over yesterday's; this isn't always possible, but strive to do this whenever possible.</li><li>Develop a unique and consistent style. People new to my work should be able to understand where more of my work fits into the 'puzzle'. If you're familiar with my work, you should be able to recognize instantly whether some content is 1. consistent with my interests and 2. whether I have made it.</li></ul></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-06</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/dfbe37e0f13327018d9ba82d287ae50c8282e6e7//journals/2023-03-06.md">dfbe37e0</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-06</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/98e7e911c30686530991265495e89b2f72ce5999//journals/2023-03-06.md">98e7e911</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-06</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/d39662d23d4938263c2c5b89cbbe4c62dfd04ad0//journals/2023-03-06.md">d39662d2</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-06</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/9d4f6b4999eda31bf197b7e824b2c68f09b2d186//journals/2023-03-06.md">9d4f6b49</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-03-08.html">2023-03-08</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-03-03.html">2023-03-03</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></div></div></div></body></html>
