I need a decentnon-monospace font on this machine for Emacs to default to for writingthings like this; I like the idea of summoning a focused environment.</p><p>Some rough ideas of public and private spaces, and America's shifttowards private works.</p><p>Context: I'm flying from Portland to Austin, thinking about howbeautiful and fit for its environment the Phoenix (layover) airport isdespite its intent to be incredibly functional, thinking about whatmakes a city beautiful and worth living in as I evaluate my options anddecide where to settle down and how and why, and why not Portland andwhy not Boston, etcâ€¦ about monuments, and beautiful architectural works,and why they matter.</p><p>Building monuments used to be a role of great states. Societies, havingaccumulated some level of self-governance, power, wealth, and prestige,set out to establish beautiful foundations for their cities. DC nor Romewere built in a day, but of course both Hadrian and Jefferson dreamed oflived environments that could represent the development of seats ofempires; Napoleon reconstructed Paris to be rebuilt in a wonderfullyliveable and consistent fashion. None of these cities were built in aday; they have been built and rebuilt to last, through fires and</p><p>Where are our great works today?</p><p>Most American work in the last 100 years - aside from a few chancesponsorships of modernist architecture and establishing functional,critical infrastructure - has operated outside of government. The lasthighly orchestrated works of public architecture in the US, I believe,are in Chicago; their wonderful opportunity to reclaim and reconstructthe majority of their lakefront property aligned beautifully withglobalization efforts like the World's Fair, spawning great works ofarchitecture built for people; built to impress and help experience.</p><p>We spend the 1950s suburbanizing and building buildings not to serve thebest needs of the people, but to advantage conglomerates and industry;to incentivize suburbanization as the final step towards colonizingAmerica everywhere (How far can you drive on a given highway todaywithout passing a subdivision?), to create career aspiration for people,and to continue to foster industry. The interesting phenomena here arethe globalization/homogenization of the nation and American experience(pushing suburbs often pushed families apart, turning rich culturalbackgrounds into grandma's recipes and making burgers and high schoolsand football the true "American culture", and with this came morerampant redistricting and erasure of minority spaces by white people, ofcourse), this sentence needs to be shorter. The rise of mass media, andwith it advertising, emerge to distribute and manufacture demand - thereis likely a good Oglivy quote to throw in here - and sell peoplepromises of higher-quality lifestyles than their upbringing through thedepression or pre-immigration, and of course this all becomes tied toyour benefits or health insurance package or credit score or mortgageand it turns out that the suburb you live in is selected by the companyyou work for, and we start to see a new kind of industrial town form,one that's not necessitated by mining or creating of natural resourcesbut actually artificially contrived to be a town for a specificindustry, like Sweetwater's suburb. \[For better or for worse, citysensationalism and individualism has killed most of these job towns,with the internet accelerating their downfall and ubiquitous remote workputting the nail in the coffin for many\].</p><p>But our cities work the same way, now; we've privatized so muchinfrastructure that there is no escaping these monopolies of telecom, ofheat and water and gas and electric, of Hudson Yards and the killing ofthe NYC Metro card, of the Citizen app and all of this.</p><p>Today, most development in America seems to be the result of large,private companies. These can be great works - Hudson Yards finished thehigh line with a level of coordination I don't think NYC would have beenable to muster themselves - but their incentives often don't align withthe needs of the people, all of the people, who inhabit these publicspaces, and often have some monopolistic interest in privatizingnominally public physical space. They can refuse service to anyone, andsuddenly most of the city bathrooms are behind cafes and paywalls andthere is ever more room for discrimination.</p><p>The rest of the essay:</p><ul><li>The decline of American infrastructure as a result of this 50s boom Idescribe</li><li>How have other countries (i.e. Singapore) continued this tradition ofbuilding monumental architecture?</li><li>Is the privatization of our cities an overall good?</li><li>Where do we go from here?
