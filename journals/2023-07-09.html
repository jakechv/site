We're going to shoot for an Instagram post once a week. No exceptions.</li></ul><p>Daily posts weren't useful for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>Not enough people were engaged because the work was poor.</li><li>The photos couldn't tell stories. It's really hard to say something across multiple days with photos found on the fly.</li><li>With my 'dynamic' work schedule and social life, it's difficult to know whether I have time on a specific day to edit and post a photo. It's not always possible for me to allocate the necessary thirty minutes to an hour to make that happen.</li><li>Daily photos don't build me to a larger goal. They accomplished one goal of mine - to keep thinking about photography - but instead of encouraging me to spend more and more time, I started cutting corners and producing bad work to meet that deadline rather than doing what I know I can do best.</li></ul><p>Making an Instagram post:</p><ul><li>On Monday, think ahead about a theme, idea, or concept to tell a story about.</li><li>Group Lightroom photos and Google photos into an album based on that theme.</li><li>Figure out what new photos are necessary to complete that theme. Group those photos together.</li><li>On Tuesday, start playing with edits of existing photos. See which photos fit best together. Try introducing some new photos you've taken over the past day or so.</li><li>On Wednesday, go out and shoot. Walk around for awhile. Find a friend and take photos. All of these things.</li><li>On Thursday, put together a final set of words, edits and group of photos.</li><li>On Friday morning, review that selection to make sure it's cool and double check your work.</li><li>On Friday afternoon, put together and make the social media post. Try to hit multiple platforms.</li><li>Take the weekend to explore. Socialize. Walk around. Take as many photos as you can. Find new places and new people. Keep seeing them.** 18:34I'll have to be okay with compromising on my time to pursue all of the work I'm interested in. I still believe that I can do it all. There is so much time in my life that I am not using wisely, and now that I can trust my digital infrastructure a little more, I can continue to put the right systems in place to organize life.</li></ul><p>Once I have a BankID, I can add the gym to my schedule. Then I can pin down a food schedule (though that has no blockers today). Then work and sleep. Then the rest of life. Having a healthy foundation of food and friends, though, is the most important thing that I can do for myself now.</p><p>When should I eat dinner? 7-8PM? Lunch at noon seems reasonable. Only two meals - with a snack and a banana, or just a banana, at about 10 AM in the morning.</p><p>I'll figure out the rest as I settle into a rhythm.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-07-09</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/e0a38ff6f83e48af7b24b3c8a19b3ea76d6e0f03//2023-07-09.md">e0a38ff6</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-07-09</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/60ca8dd5f3b240a6dda4243e2ce1b59b86d72c19//2023-07-09.md">60ca8dd5</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-07-09</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/2307b0be4a64496e5c958efe10e78ca6fd91d17b//2023-07-09.md">2307b0be</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-07-10.html">2023-07-10</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-07-06.html">2023-07-06</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
