Those grooves aren't accidental or a consequence of the manufacturing process; they're grooves made for people to use.** 18:48I make things for people to use.</p><p>People want their things to be fast. They want it to be straightforward - easy - to do whatever they'd like to do. They want their tools to work for them and not get in their way. They want the boundaries of some tools to end and others to begin in the right places. They want consistency and for their tools to not change too often and to enjoy what they do every day.** 18:58https://www.are.na/block/5007365</p><p>I want to use a website that renderrs text like this - over natural materials. I want to interact with jeans.** 18:59Was told at work not to work so much and to develop a consistent schedule insteat. I think I'm so addicted to work because I finally have agency over a product that I want to succeed and that has customers. I want to be able to make things for people and I finally have the opportunity to do so.</p><p>The best way to meet people is to broadcast myself online and in person.

A personal identity can be forever even if a company isn't.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-04-14</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/83abd62955a092e3a927e06d188174dbb996240b//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-14.md">83abd629</a></td></tr><tr><td>2023-04-14</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/26038036a52e84d9b507e31d06dd7a7fc075a796//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-14.md">26038036</a></td></tr><tr><td>2023-04-14</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/80e3435d550811a98d136be8596d85a4af88d850//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-14.md">80e3435d</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
