What's wrong here?** 19:20I think you leave a legacy by doing the same thing every day and getting a little better each time. So long as you have that deliverable date, each deadline gives you the opportunity to experiment; you can make and make and make and make and make and make forever, one day at a time. I love looking at and collecting design inspiration because it lets me see how other people have iterated and grown; I love seeing the end product and the polish, but I wish I could see their way of working. How important is it for others to be transparent? How important is it to write or think critically about the work and practice of others?</li></ul><p>This is prompting a newsletter idea - maybe, once a week, I should conduct a design overview of an artist, old or contemporary, trying to capture their key ideas, my favorite works from them, and their ways of working. This can lead to interviews with contemporary people and highlight historic innovators, providing an opportunity to both talk to new people and reflect critically on the context behind these images I keep saving and attributing on the internet. It's clear that writing these little notes and posting a photo every day is valuable - what can I add to my routine next?</p><p>I want to try a dumb phone like the nokia banana phone when I get to sweden. My camera is already perfect. Maybe it will help me focus. I like that the yellow can be spotted from a million miles away. I'm inspired by all of Naoto Fukasawa's designs for 'dumb phones' and for Muji; these are just enough Dieter Rams with a little bit of late modernist personality injected. Some of them aren't distinctly his; they don't have any sort of distinct style and feel like a vessel for the user to use in their own life. Is this the best way to approach objects? I love owning gifts from others, objects with distinct taste and personality and feeling. I want them to feel playful and be reminder of the people who made these objects when I touch them. I want my work to feel like this to others; to feel important and made by me without having to sign it or tag it or do anything to distinguish.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-09</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/6fd4909923756d4dde421f07c839d1292d1b6d1e//journals/2023-03-09.md">6fd49099</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-09</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/6a9ce54bbc6510370321e9dcf72751861bb667a3//journals/2023-03-09.md">6a9ce54b</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-03-11.html">2023-03-11</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-03-08.html">2023-03-08</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
