For a consumer product I should decide to pursue aline of work by considering how much time that the finished work savesothers (considering <strong>all</strong> the time they spend figuring out how to usethe product, etc) relative to how much time I invest; the highest ratioof \`others' time\` / \`my time\` is best worth the effort.</p><p>I think this is reasonable as it measures both usefulness and <strong>ease ofuse</strong>. A lot of developer tools get trapped in these claims thatinstalling and learning and using and debugging their software 'will beworth it'; this metric rewards effort spent to reduce time to use of theproduct as much as possible. Reducing time to install and time toactionable product is why web apps exist as a phenomenon, and we deserveto have it for native apps and linux extensions as well.</p><p>Only accept seamless setup processes, regardless of the level ofcomplexity accepted by the user of the software. Work should be aone-click or one-command install without leaving behind dirt to becleaned up. This is why I believe in Nix so strongly: \`nix shell\`,\`nix flake\`, and the ability to reproducible builds of software off ofa git url is a superpower.</p><p>The language is obtuse, sure - and it's incredibly difficult to getgoing - but end users don't need to understand Nix. They just need toknow what flake commands to run to get any output of any program off theweb.</p><h2 id="1149-names">11:49 names</h2><p>Names are important. I love the focus of <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/tutorial/">Cairo'sdocumentation</a> on verbage -"First I'll describe the nouns: destination, source, mask, path, andcontext. After that I'll describe the verbs which offer ways tomanipulate the nouns and draw the graphics you wish to create." Thewords ostensibly have nothing to do with the end goal - but they're moreimportant. This theme of 'speaking the language' of a discipline comesup again and again - computers are designed to help people assign namesto concepts and to experiment with these concepts, a view realized byPapert, by Felleisen, by so many people who work with computers. This isnot unique to computers, or computer science, or anything; mathematicsis obsessed with names, as is construction work, as is architecture, asthere is no better way to speak about something in an effective way thanto develop a vocabulary for it.</p><p>Different computing systems let you speak in different ways and usedifferent vocabularies. C - or (arguably) better, Zig - let you speakthe language of assembly, the language of Unix, the language of thekernel, the language of the computer. You inject your vocabulary intothe language - by assigning names to variables, types and functions -but you have no ability to change the language of the system.</p><p>This also holds for Lisps; you speak the language of lists, ofparentheses, but you embed your domain in them; this set of lists meansthis, and this symbol or tag indicates that, and some function allowsyou to transform your inputs from this to that.</p><p>ML languages like Rust are different, deeper. Taagged unions allow youto embed your vocabulary into the type system, the error messages, themechanics of the language. The strong type system lets you embed yourlanguage into the target, to further restrict the user of your code tospeak both the programming language and the language you establish forothers to use.</p><p>Which is better? To me, strong type systems and mathematics gohand-in-hand. Math is so valuable on paper because its a constructedenvironment for a language; different types of proofs speak differentlanguages, sometimes graphical, always constrained, and it's vital thatthe user of the system speaks both the language of the prover and thelanguage of the mathematical domain that others have constructed forthis user. Learning to speak an object language is difficult, and thetype system exists to give the user this linguistic superpower.</p><p>Most of programming, though, doesn't interoperate with a single system.Programming requires glueing different code together, developinghigher-level abstractions, and so forth, combining different librariesto produce end results. Thisâ€¦ doesn't bode well for ML. Not only dolibraries built for ML-like languages have to speak the system language,they also have to learn to conform to all of this community parlance andall of the object languages that others have embedded in the system.</p><p>Solutions to this mostly involve assuming parts of the object languageas the standard library, but community consensus is incredibly difficultregardless - some people don't like the way the Rust Error type isstructured, for example, so they make their own incompatible errortypes, so glueing together different rust Error types is a mess.</p><p>If the language is strong and gives the power of manipulation of thecode language to the user, though, the user can interact with the systemdifferently. This is where the row types of typescript and typed racketcome in - now the user can use these types but still interoperatebetween type names, as what really matters is the (partial) contents ofthe type rather than the community parlance used to name the types.Maybe it's better to be free, though - if everything is a list, oreverything is an \`mmapped\` segment of memory, then the programmer caneasily and seamlessly peel some data apart and provide it to otherlibraries. Though the names might not be the same, typically similardata is conducive to similar abstractions; it's not uncommon for movingdata from one library to another in Common Lisp for me to be a \`cadr\`or a \`cons\` away, and picking a good name for the function to makethat transformation seals the deal.</p><p>Maybe it's okay to only make programmers learn the domain language andnot the object language - the rest can come.</p><h2 id="1415-sick">14:15 sick</h2><p>Of course the day after I preach about wanting to do more I wake up sickas hell.</p><p>A lot of exploratory work today - Zig talks, some thinking, readingdocumentation, and flipping through books throughout my apartment - withsome photos - but the brain feels too fried to be able to really operateand get deep into coding work. Looking at a big hurts, so I put on lightmusic or talks off of YouTube in the background. Wondering if there areany podcasts that aren't about news or fads, that feel less ephemeral -it's hard to find.</p><p>Cold things and slimy things feel the same - my hands are so extremelycold that I thought I'd spilled water on my clothes when I touched myface. Oh, moisture can condense on something! But I don't feel likethere is moisture on the thing - the touch just feels similar.</p><p>Content creation? Seems valuable for learning to visualize and presentinformation. TikTok videos are fun.</p><h2 id="1432-document-yourself-through-other-people">14:32 document yourself through other people</h2><p>on the internet. much easier than doing it yourself.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2022-12-10.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
