I love feeling the drive to win. Iwant to be able to summon up some feeling, some content that puts me ina particular state of mind… that gives me the determination to dosomething impactful and important. A motivational speech or something…how valuable would this be? How do we productize motivation? The abilityto motivate everyone - as I suppose some content creators attempt toleverage traditional socials for - would be beautiful. (The otherimplications of such a technology - invoking compassion, revisitingloss, experiencing love - are just as valuable).</p><p>I've been seeing a lot of this content lately. Sports, and any otherathletic work (as opposed to knowledge work) needs motivation; you needto be the best in the world at that moment, or at least good enough tobeat that other team. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03AjS4SGMo">Jamaal Williams speech from Hardknocks</a> touched merecently… I didn't care at all about football until I saw him feel sostrongly about the Lions - and so passionate about his position and histeam. Likewise, the news that George Hotz has flipped from Comma AI (acompany that aims to both "make driving chill" and "win self-drivingcars") to Twitter after Elon's takeover with a desire to revolutionizethe platform and impact what's most important, has had me flip throughsome writing of his discussing his - and, by extension, the Comma -philosophy.</p><p>Key takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>Real life is the best game anyone can play. To me, this contrast islike living in Coq and writing POPL papers vs. freeballing with CommonLisp or JS at a startup. Video games, sports and type theory havesimple, beautiful axioms, whether they're "get the ball into the goalwith no hands" or the "Calculus of Inductive Constructions", and allowplayers to derive and develop complex strategies from them, often - insports in particular - allowing the exploration of those constraintsto evolve the game itself (with patches of an exceptional nature,similar to the law; Preston <a href="https://twitter.com/prestonattebery/status/1596653459721576449">enlightenedme</a>about the depth of the game of basketball here, for example).</p><p>Those ideas are beautiful, and they derive some ideas from reality toapproximate it - but, notably, they <strong>aren't</strong>. My stack of Coq proofsfailed to consider that someone pouring water on my verified PCB wouldtake my lightbulb machine out. Someone recently pointed out to me thatwe tend to over-correct or over-assume that skills we develop underdifferent models will extend or apply to others, often in an attemptto justify that perfecting an easy task will help perfect a difficultone, but this doesn't work. Tasks done in direct support of the realdeliverable - say, practicing shooting on goal to hone your shotaccuracy for a real game of football - will pay off, but unlessperformed deliberately in support of an end, some means like squattingat the gym to focus on hamstrings may not actually correct your poorfootwork in the penalty box if that problem isn't your biggestblocker.</p><p>A lot of software systems will let you fall down this trap, too;fighting the typechecker to justify things is probably the biggestexample of this today. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ab3ArE8W3s&amp;t=1512s">"Stop Writing DeadPrograms"</a>, JackRusher hammers this home better than anyone else. Types can constructgames that can be played, but they don't construe real, runnable code;you're justifying your work against a pretty abstraction of realitythat lives in type theory, not the practical world that your productoccupies. His thesis, which I echo here, is that improving the"liveness" of your system is the biggest improvement you can make toyour development process. Getting end-to-end testable and runnablecode into the real world as soon as possible, testing by runningagainst a real system with real people and getting feedback, is theonly thing that matters; otherwise, you're playing the typechecker'sgame, the abstractor's, or the reasearcher's rather than testingagainst reality. You want your code to effect real change in theworld - so you should test it that way too.</p></li><li><p>Make knowledge freely available to encourage progress and competition.Comma AI is completely open-source, robust software, built for anyoneto use to augment an existing tool; this is central to its valueproposition. Any auto manufacturer or wannabe self-driving car startupcan download Comma, throw it in their vehicle, and ship a "Powered byComma" (MIT license abiding) self-driving system of their own. Hotzrecognizes the significant surplus of value that's given away anddoesn't really care - everyone should have access to the knowledge,and he has the confidence that his team will directly outcompeteanyone forking and selling his stuff. if someone kills them atself-driving, they deserve to win, and the mission of trueself-driving cars is accomplished anyways; company finances aresecondary.</p><p>Likewise, if my car isn't supported by Comma, I'm free to add supportto its control system to the software to make it work. The job of thecompany is to develop the technology necessary to allow cars to drivethemselves; if I want it, my job is to make <strong>my</strong> car drive itself. Ican buy the devkit and make it work. Dozens of people have. Theability for anyone to fix anything creates demonstrable value for thecompany and for people. Adding my car isn't some one-off hack; it's away to let anyone with my car use this self-driving system withoutadditional work. Everyone wins.</p></li><li><p>Solve only the problem you need to. Comma deliberately appliedspecific constraints at the outset: their product is, and has alwaysaimed to be, a single plug-and-play hardware box that augments yourcar without modification. The entire system has been developed withthis constraint in mind.</p><p>Other companies all hijack their hardware in some way; some makedesign affordances in existing vehicles and play the game of carcollaborations to weasel their infrastructure in, others happen to bethe car company, and one company is building their own car fromscratch to make the thing happen.</p><p>Guess whose software benchmarks best?</p></li></ul><p>The importance of people - through their writing, words and actions - tomotivate others cannot be underscored. Blue Lock - at its face a mangaabout soccer - has been particularly motivational for me; whether thisis wholly the intention of the author, I'm not sure, but my tenure as amediocre soccer player from 6-18 absolutely plays a role (myrelationship with the sport was something I'd always done).</p><p>Sure, games aren't real life, but the way in which Kaneshiro distillsthe sport into its motivating factors with the deliberate intent ofimparting inspiration is fascinating. I pick up a chapter, watch Yoichikill it in another match by deliberately observing his faults, thenlooking at what others do to improve himself and win, and feel like Ican be the best at something. I'm not going to win self-driving carslike Hotz, but I'll be fighting to improve the world of agriculture -and, in the meantime, I'll become a damn good produce developer.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2022-11-26.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
