Produce more 'content'. DO MORE.** 13:19Missed shot - leather jacket in early afternoon light with a fly at the top right. Would have been brilliant.</li></ul><p>Poor shot - experimenting with low shutter speed in Odenplan. Being afraid of taking a photo of someone close to me. Have imperfect results saved.** 15:06Employee at by:fiket - a bit of a goofy, outgoing character - awesome person - asked me how he could improve on making the mocha as I was leaving.</p><p>What an awesome idea - I'm so glad. I wish I had had more advice for him.** 21:35Photo learnings today:</p><ul><li>Hold the camera as still as you can</li><li>Consider experimenting with manual mode</li><li>I love those shots of people in buildings</li><li>Discovering some dynamic compositions close to people</li><li>My movement can be good if I carefully consider what's in frame - learn to move the camera better adn control the motion</li><li>Most of the photos I want to shoot naturally fit with a longer focal length, and I feel like a lot of the time I am forcing the GR iii to do something it's not built for. It's a great indoor camera, but I'm still having a hard time forcing it outdoors.** 21:38Meta-notes on making videos and writing without thinking: it's okay for writing to be 'off the dome' because you see immediate feedback and correct it. This can be done in YouTube videos too - take a second to figure out the idea, say 'oops', control your pace, and figure it out in post.</li></ul><p>In conversation, you have to control your thoughts and your pace prematurely. Take it slow. Think about it a little bit. Then slowly let the words out, word by word, carefully choosing the framework beforehand and filling in the gaps.** 21:44Also thinking about the best hobbies for learning how to learn. Photos are a perfect example. Barrier to entry is zero: literally walk outside and click a button. Barrier for feedback: super low. Post a photo on Instagram or send to someone else and ask their opinion. Community of practice: huge. Bad community of practice: huge. Really good people in modern day - a lot of them. Lots to aspire to do, can feel the huge gap, can clearly quantify getting better.</p><p>The tighter the feedback loop on your thinking can be, the faster you can learn and the better you can make things.</p><p>Gym takes a few weeks - I'd say two - to pay off positively with mood benefits. Eating takes a few days but is hard to directly establish the association. Photos are instant gratification: you see the image in the monitor and you think you win.** 21:47Thinking about what Fuji guy (sorry your name is in my phone but not on my computer) told me about composing on his camera - he just uses the black and white filter on the camera and uses the color RAW files. Intention is to focus on the composition in the camera then shift to considering the colors in post.</p><p>Is this good?</p><p>I think it would be a good exercise for learning. I'm not sure if it could help me make the best images possible. Color is so important to consider in a final image.</p><p>Should I force myself to shoot black and white jpegs for a bit and see what happens?</p><p>Should I bring back the Fuji focal length and see what happens?</p><p>Yes to the second. No to the first. I love color too much to give it up, and I love photos too much to miss an image because of a decision I made.** 22:01Why am I doing something that so many people are?</p><p>Walking around and crossing my fingers for shots is starting to feel frivolous; what am I really documenting? What is really what I want to picture? Can I really compete in such a crowded market? Am I really expressing myself? Is this really helping me meet people? Is taking photos a good use of my time?** 22:07More websites. There aren't enough websites.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-26</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/a19eccbfba098545e7b7dc0199d554face00214d//2023-09-26.md">a19eccbf</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-26</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/96c89d8a097702b7de7b129efcfcd177391b657d//2023-09-26.md">96c89d8a</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-26</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/202eaf8089c904cd54717a65779aa99fd701f72a//2023-09-26.md">202eaf80</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-26</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/29a78a8e97c55d86ae764630fcf716299dbba780//2023-09-26.md">29a78a8e</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-26</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/b9b62e02dd9dd4e986678a60595756b4b3d45a1d//2023-09-26.md">b9b62e02</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-26</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/103c30bd4aad1a953f9b032dcdd425ee79be782c//2023-09-26.md">103c30bd</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-26</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/38ac848d3662f387ef96744395812cbb1070f645//2023-09-26.md">38ac848d</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-26</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/90ac804da357941c453ee93ffc63d4f800c99a62//2023-09-26.md">90ac804d</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-09-27.html">2023-09-27</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-09-25.html">2023-09-25</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
