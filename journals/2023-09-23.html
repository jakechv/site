At work, I can generally identify who on the (9 person team) has written a passage based on their writing style, formatting, and other little hints throughout - a quirk of poor punctuation, a common misspelling, a certain phrase of words tehy use often.** 10:13The morning is for getting ahead - the evening is for cleaning up.</li></ul><p>I think I will shift my workout schedule to the morning. It feels 'active' - not like 'maintenance' - and the last two hours of my day should be spent cleaning and organizing. In a way, everything I do feels like organizing; the code, for example, already exists; I just need to arrange and compose it in a way that solved my problem.</p><p>Maybe my plants need watering. Maybe I can do that now.</p><p>I think I have to accept that creating mess during the day is okay, too - as long as it's taken care of by the end of the day (or the next morning). I deserve a fresh start.</p><p>Talk at work yesterday - "You have to have a plan for when you'll end, or you could just work forever". That's my problem - I don't define time or space for me to do particular things, so I don't do much of anything and none of my time is reserved for me to accomplish anything in particular.</p><p>This is part of my effort to aggressively calendar retroactively - to visualize time spent is to take control of it.** 10:51</p><p>Coney Island -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xw68q0jipg -- maybe New York City is the center of the world -- or, at least, one of them.** 12:30I write more words at work than I code - if you count comments. I think this is the correct approach** 12:48Forgot how good the Framework feels. The Macbook is robust - engineered- a beautiful artifact, a design machine, complete for people to use.</p><p>My Framework - with two years of NixOS, a light metal frame, and a few dents under its belt - is charming by comparison. It's a machine built for hacking, that begs to be remade and recrafted and redone over and over again, for debugging and hacking all sorts of beautiful system utiliteis and projects. The machine encourages you to remake it, transform it. It can do anything - you just have to make it happen and write the code to do it.** 16:05How do I format these notes as 500 word essays?</p><p>Love https://stephango.com</p><p>Wondering how I can make a system to help myself do the same** 17:06Loving the way the ilcaffe lights shake and move a bit when someone leaves their seat in the back - a trace of them is left in their place, swaying, lingering, for fifteen or so minutes afterwards.** 21:04I missed two really awesome photos today. One - woman in party gear looking down at Slussen. Two - woman immaculately dressed, looking very professional, flipping beer can above her head 180 degrees and pouring into her mouth alone - through the subway system window in Odenplan.</p><p>First one I was too scared to take - I was worried about being confrontational. I would not have been.</p><p>Second one - just didn't have the camera ready. I was too overwhelmed by the process of getting off the train to make myself alert.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/2a7f31cd673af04f90037570c438622e82d5117c//2023-09-23.md">2a7f31cd</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-23</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/a26d30562a5cc55f442b861fde31865c10eb4a2c//2023-09-23.md">a26d3056</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-23</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/7860258d15b028ee7eec36b7ed569c731f74fbed//2023-09-23.md">7860258d</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-23</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/53be42548061e6f416bb37090fe76c4865f4bd09//2023-09-23.md">53be4254</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-23</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/10427c73f73f96fc2d2b5c3708fa012a3345ca22//2023-09-23.md">10427c73</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-09-24.html">2023-09-24</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-09-22.html">2023-09-22</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
