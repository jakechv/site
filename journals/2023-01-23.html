Ideally:</p><ol><li>Read the literature</li><li>Start a particular idea</li><li>Invest in the idea for a period of time</li><li>Publish initial work</li><li>Iterate based on reception, feedback and thinking to myself</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, I continue to stagnate before steps 3 or 4. I'm not quitesure why, but I sense it's that I'm often either scared to execute (thatmy skills may not match my reading) or that I'm scared to publish whatI've executed (afraid of judgement). Some things have fallen to thewayside after losing some time, but most I have become scared of andtaken too long to do.</p><p>It frustrates me that things take time, and that time has to be made forthem; think posting a photo every few days, or promoting on socialmedia, or following a particular routine at the gym. These things willnever quite be for me, but they're essential - to a degree - to mysuccess, and I'm not yet consistent enough to make things happen.</p><p>Let's talk solutions:</p><ul><li><p>Add ongoing projects to a schedule and block out time every day forthem. Right now:</p><ul><li>Photography (take photos for \~30m a day, spend \~30 a day editing)</li><li>Gym (4-5x/week, spending the other two biking or playing soccer)</li><li>Cooking (Spend 15m/day investigating recipes, type them up, thencook dinner every evening \[indeterminate\])</li><li>Website (Push out one small feature a day. Examples: Parsingorg-mode tags, parsing parts of journal files, rendering journals toHTML.). I want to maintain this forever, so it's vital that I payattention to it daily.</li><li>Architecture. Right now, I think my focus should be on learning tosketch; I look at enough buildings and spend enough time reading andcollecting inspiration. I just need to dedicate myself to sketching.This can probably done in conjunction with the photography work,overlapping with it, with a physical paper and pencil of some sort.\[TBD\]</li><li>Social time \[1h/day\]. Dedicated time strengthening a personalrelationship I have, in person. This can be combined with any or allof the above points; there are lots of people I can spend time withor reach out to. Make it a point to schedule these a week or more inadvance so that this project work can be planned out.</li><li>Finding a subletter for my apartment.</li><li>Finding housing in Stockholm.</li></ul></li><li><p>Dedicate the majority of the day to solving technical debt I've letmyself accrue:</p><ul><li>Common Lisp type project. This can be put on maintenance mode once Imeet the deliverables I've promised, but until then I need to gofull-speed ahead.</li><li>Prepare whatever I need to apply to Interact. If I don't get in, Iwill regret it forever (Due February 15; we need to deliversomething truly remarkable by this time and start writingapplication essays). Write my essays first, then spend the monthdoing the technical work I'll need to do to show that I'm buildingtowards the mission I preach about.</li></ul></li><li><p>Avoid historical time-wasters:</p><ul><li>Social media. It's a reflex. I can spend this clearing technicaldebt or looking at \`are.na\` feeds for inspiration, or at recipes,or on clothing or something to hone my taste and style. Retrain.</li><li>Inconsistent sleep schedule. Ideally this is solved by making itconsistent lol.</li><li>Indecision. Hopefully this plan helps.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I'll see how disciplined I can be</p><h2 id="1535">15:35</h2><p>caring check.eml i care about</p><p>beautiful public spaces and built environments</p><p>bike lanes, streetcars, and ways for everyone to travel through the citywhile experiencing the city</p><p>making computers fun and enjoyable for people to use, while betterexposing them to abstractions that help them truly understand whatthey're doing</p><p>owning portable, beautiful items that last forever: bags, clothes,computers, cameras. they have the right level of appropriate purpose -general enough to use daily and fit in a backpack, but specific enoughto do one thing and do it well.</p><p>user interfaces to computing</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td><a href="/journals/2023-01-23.html#monday-01232023">monday-01232023</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/journals/2023-01-23.html#0127-out-of-sync">0127-out-of-sync</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/journals/2023-01-23.html#1535">1535</a></td></tr></table></div><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2023-01-23.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></body></html>
