Open-source font projects exist - and many of those that do are truly exceptional - but most of the leading type foundries keep their work proprietary (and inaccessibly expensive). The tools to build fonts with free software are still immature, especially if you can't program.</li><li>Bitmap fonts are brilliant in their own way - for their ease of use. I wonder if there are technologies to 'smooth them over' to convert them to TTF fonts if they're specified at a high enough resolution. This also seems impossible, as the decision to 'smooth something over' is entirely aesthetic, and the small details of these details is so important.</li><li>Rendering fonts is a mess.</li><li>Ligatures can be used for so many brilliant things. I love the '99 balloons' look.</li><li>New appreciation for 'Inter'. I'm not happy with some of the parts of the font that have been rounded off - loose ends and such (without a better word) - but the fact that inter is brilliant for legibility in every use case is incredible. I wouldn't choose another free font for a user interface after trying it - it's the best default imaginable.</li><li>Even great type designers miss little details. I keep finding little edges - little cracks - of designs that don't feel as thought-out as the type designer would like to have you believe. Studying type teaches you to appreciate pixel-perfect detail in a way that not many other crafts can.</li><li>I like 'neo-grotesk' fonts with sharp edges.</li><li>Univers might be the best font. All of the principled fonts that I like are variations of Univers.</li><li><p>Tricks for making fonts more readable:</p><ul><li>Fonts must be incredibly legible at their most thin to readability on small screens.</li><li>Perfect the spacing, the punctuation, and particular letters.</li><li>Picking a few letters to make 'flash' can help your font stand out in a competition, but particular letters that are distracting significantly hinder readability.</li><li>Multi-language support is insane. Practically impossible. I'm immensely appreciative of type designers who work across language boundaries - especially when deviating from Latin characters.</li></ul></li></ul></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-05-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/2a91646e17b55b0e8d887566ec2fde4b9d76031e//journals/2023-05-24.md">2a91646e</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
