I should be able to build a package from 0 - including downloading the compiler and its dependencies - off of a fresh <code>git clone</code> with a single command in 1 minute max. It's insane that Rust takes so long and pulls in gigs of information. This just isn't sustainable. My <code>launch</code> software didn't even work on my own system by default, even when using <code>nix</code>, when working in isolation... I'm missing some dynamic linking package that needs to be part of the path.</li></ul><p>There are two paths we can take here;</p><ol><li>Use Java. The JVM solves our dynamic linking problem. HumbleUI is somewhat promising and I'll likely have access to most of the libraries I need. This code is 'fast enough' - but I'm not sure whether <code>HumbleUI</code> and Clojure desktop apps will have a future in industry at large.</li><li>Use Zig. Write code at a low level with a toolchain that's focused on minimal interfaces and performance. Code is small and fast but at the cost of my time. Learning Zig is a huge pro. Supposedly the compiler iterates fast but there is also no package version control. Zig absolutely has a future but I'll have to learn more myself.</li></ol><p>Zig is probably the way to go here. It'll take longer to get started, but the toolchain is fast and has a promising future. I'll be able to write very fast code and learn a lot about systems programming in the process. It'll allow me to help build good infrastructure, work with games code to make beautiful desktop apps, and contribute to a fresh ecosystem.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-05-11</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/78a8970b3dc1f51dc193a3b4229207f6032faf7f//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-05-11.md">78a8970b</a></td></tr><tr><td>2023-05-11</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/fb4ea1c7703c16c6bc39d1f024a1276a36168be6//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-05-11.md">fb4ea1c7</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
