Have a lot ofregrets and a lot of things I'd like to try next.</p><p>Ultimately, I over-valued some advice, didn't take other advice intoconsideration, and didn't pursue what I thought I wanted - and what I'dbe best at. I undervalued participation in institution and the value ofprofessors, and realized the value of socialization too late to get aton out of it. Turns out that participating in institutions, clubs, andorganizations is incredibly valuable - as is putting in a lot of effortto make those institutiosn successful. I underrated the value I'd getand receive from those organizations and over-valued "cool" without everreally reaching it.</p><p>Why classes? I took advice for skipping out of sections, thencomflicting advice to not skip, then ended up wasting a bunch of my timewalking around and doing things that didn't really matter - particularlyfor the first half of college. I may have spent more time mocking someunderstanding of work at a high level than actually spending the time tounderstand it - and this is something I really regret. I undervalued theidea that building a supportive community would help me build more,thinking that I could do everything on my own and well - which was a bitof a silly mindset.</p><p>Ultimately, "doing the work" and focusing on a reasonable amount of workthat I was truly interested in, under a mentor that I respected, wouldhave been far more valuable than fiddling in the dark with differentideas and reading internet threads. I've learned a lot from reading -and learned a lot about how to read and write about technology,consequently - but I haven't actually done the work, and consequently Idon't have the in-depth understanding of anything, really, that I'd liketo have.</p><p>It's not clear that pursuing undergrad right after high school was thebest decision for me; working at CDK Global for a minute prior topursuing college may have made a lot more sense for me and provided mebetter opportunities.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/journals/2022-12-06.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
