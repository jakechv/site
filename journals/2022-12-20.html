To me, Portland (proper) is a place wheresustainable taste and appreciation are put first - nothing here feels asif it's rushed and everything feels focused on some form of beauty. Thecity has many of the best restaurants I've been to in the world, it'swalkable and bikeable and driveable all the same, and its smallclothing, musical, creative and literary communities are incrediblyrich - it's no wonder that Portland seems to export a seriouslydisproportionate amount of talent to its size. The forest that envelopsand surrounds the city - with endless trails and great architecturaldesign buried throughout - is just as beautiful as the city itself, andis likely why it's become such an interesting cultural location.</p><p>This time, though, I think I'm just learning that Portland is too smallfor me. The city hasn't managed its poverty and crime issues downtown,and they've gotten worse - the people at my favorite clothing store inthe world told me that they've had "a couple of" recent break-ins, andhalf of their windows were boarded up; everyone I saw walking around onthe street (granted, on a Monday evening) looked incredibly sad,dragging their feet or scavenging for trash, and there was nothing Icould do to uplift; those working in stores were optimistic, but I don'tsee them spending much time outside between work and home. Powell's isstill one of my favorite bookstores - it was my first exposure tobeautiful books - but now I've met people like Michael at KatherineSmall, and I'm realizing that large establishments will never compare toindividually loved and curated collections, to a person who has thedomain knowledge to recommend you such beautiful things, to someone whois active 'in the field'. Portland feels like a place for generalistappreciation, but I'm realizing that I'm beginning to specialize; and Idon't think the city offers the kind and depth of subcommunities I wantto participate in. Reading about the culture at Stanford's SAIL, of someinnovative software clubhouse where people lived and worked and sleptand dreamed Human-Computer Interaction, or even of the subculturallifestyles that people live in SF or NYC, like Joe Kerwin or Parker orany of these characters I keep in touch with on the internet, has mefeeling left out in a quiet place like Portland.</p><p>It's a good place to create, and a good place to last - but I don'tthink it's a place that can be conducive to the sort of explosion ofenthusiasm that I see happen in New York, in San Francisco, in Boston.It's a wonderful place to be quiet, consistent, and appreciative; but itfeels hard to become the 'next best thing' here or to play a part in it.The forest here feels like it lasts forever, as will the IPAs and coldbrew and good books and jazz festival and everything else that is invogue, but I think at this point in my life I want radical, excitingchange - and I can't find that here.</p><p>Can I build my own community? Where? How? I think I'm a strongindividual contributor but not a leader by any means; I might be able to'lead' with work and ideas, and I'm definitely personable, but my workwill not spread by person-to-person networking - I love people, but Ijust don't have the patience for a ton of social interaction that isn'tdirectly related to my interests. I dream of communities like Interact -techno-optimism might be the best substrate I've ever witnessed inperson.</p><p>\[An aside: I'm trying to develop interests in every field so that Ihave questions to ask, but I'm finding that sometimes it's really hardto pry out of people what they're really, truly interested in; the realchallenge isn't having the person state it; it's understanding theirrelationship with the subject and how you can interact with thatrelationship that's the real hurdle\]</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td id="page-map-tuesday-12202022"><a href="/journals/2022-12-20.html#tuesday-12202022">tuesday-12202022</a></td></tr><tr><td id="page-map-0110-growth-at-home"><a href="/journals/2022-12-20.html#0110-growth-at-home">0110-growth-at-home</a></td></tr></table></div><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2022-12-20.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2022-12-24.html">2022-12-24</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2022-12-19.html">2022-12-19</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></div></div></div></body></html>
