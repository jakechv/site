Nodoubt, I've used robust systems like MIT Scratch, code.org and LegoMindstorms with the express intention of conveying papert's work bystarting with (literally) the concept of turtle graphics, but they throwaway any notion of more developed physics simulations by continuing toencourage their users to memorize notation about class names andconcrete syntax.</p><p>the coding environments and their silly little games in a sandbox arecute, but they never teach kids to break out - anecdotally, i built alittle model operating system in scratch in the sixth grade with afriend - complete with garbage can and painting program - but proceededto drop computer programming for years because i felt like i had hit thelimits of the medium (and i had; the program was 5 mb, somehow maxed outthe CPU power of the devices I had access to at the time, andoccasionally crashed the scratch VM). I didn't program for yearsafterwards for this reason - that i no longer saw a path forward withthe skills i'd developed through this programming environment - andbecause i had an incredible amount of difficulty attempting to translatethe skills i'd developed with this model of a programming system toother models, like python, at the time. (this then opens up anotherbox - the "which programming language should i use?" one - that keepsyou on the edge and encourages you to dip your toes in different poolsand youtube videos and blogs without diving in. I honestly think myworld would have been simpler if someone cut off the internet, passed mea common lisp textbook, and told me to start writing). I ended upexploring other cultural avenues through the consumption of fashion,music, photography and design media, but taking a break from softwareset me so far back that i fear i'll never catch up to some of my peers -and the math and science misunderstandings i have might not berecoverable.</p><p>i don't want this to happen to other people. i want people to uselearning tools that translate into real-world, deployable, "adult"things that feel no different than what is real. it's silly to me thatthere is this divide between educational tools and pragmatic ones; thetransition should be seamless and obvious. (and provides opportunitiesfor incomeâ€¦ pay for hosting at a domain, for example).</p><p>should also encourage computing agency. introduce a metaphor for thedesktop not as a way to open programs others have created, but as aprogramming environment where all of the code in the windows is code youcan write and fiddle with and explore. my hypothesis is that buildingthis metaphor and extending it to real, production software capabilitieswill improve learning and product development demonstrably. the sandboxshould expand to the browser, to the operating system, and to shippingproducts in the real world.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2022-11-07.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
