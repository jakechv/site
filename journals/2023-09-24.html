It's the perfect camera for living life. It's not the best camera - for me - for going out and taking photos. The lens is just too wide.</li></ul><p>Should I get the GR iii X too?................** 19:29Too much NYC mythos. Nobody needs another NYC street photographer - not in that style. Watching these videos - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAKWwljJiIQ - a lot of the work feels like a copy of a copy of a copy - I don't understand where the work is coming from. He has some great photos - but not in this video. Maybe an unlucky day. The narrative about 'documenting life in the city' though doesn't feel like it adds up when there are so many people doing it?</p><p>Maybe what I'm doing is wrong too, directionless. I think it's more reflective of how I'm feeling than it is of others, or - at the least - more reflective of some theme I want to convey. What do I do it for? My instinct is to practice and keep practicing - it's not a hobby, really, it's a routine.</p><p>There are too many good photos - just like there are too many good songs and too many good websites and too many good graphic designers. (I don't think there are enough good websites or graphic designers though, really. Maybe video editors are a more apt comparison.). I don't think technology can make photos much better - we have tools today that expose the exposure latitude and dynamic range problems of previous tech generations. No camera from the last ten years has any limitations. Improvements are incremental - they decrease luck as a factor but make no fundamental changes in how things work.</p><p>There is room for different mediums that leverage the benefits of modern technology - we don't have a good camera for 'motion photos', to my knowledge, really - (or maybe I need to find one) - but it feels as if everything is trending towards video. Maybe photos are in the past. Every photo I see has been taken before; every idea has been thought of. There are new people but - as Chuck said in that essay - all of us live the same lives, really.</p><p>Maybe I should spend more time making websites then.</p><p>Okay - how am I different though?</p><ul><li>My style - shot in a street style, but a bit sculptural, respective of frames and lines and architecture - is an approach that I don't really see other people using. I think I can expand and improve on it. I think there is merit to it.</li><li>I'm in Stockholm, not in New York City or San Francisco. Culture is different here.</li><li>I have a better understanding of technology than many others.</li><li>I have taste in clothes. Beyond what works and doesn't work for me, I have an understanding of how to style and dress to convey a particular mood. I don't know how to make clothing, but I keep up with new designers that make beautiful things that others could use to express themselves.</li><li>I have engineering discipline and tools for self-reflection. I will get better and better and better.</li><li>I have no connections to musicians and no experience with portraits of people. I need to do more here.</li><li>I have no experience in studio or with artificial lights.</li><li>I have no experience with interviews.</li><li>I don't take photos in the morning.</li><li>I don't need other people to care about my photos to make them. It just happens.</li></ul><p>Cool - what can I do differently?</p><ul><li>Take photos in the morning.</li><li>Take photos in the studio.</li><li>Try interviewing people.</li><li>Try 'street portraits' in locations I love. Spend time loitering and ask cool people at those locations for photos at those locations. This has worked for me before!! Working with people is something I will never get enough experience with.</li><li>Don't worry about a particular genre.</li><li>Consume more media from interesting, contemporary photographers. Watching all of this information about the NYC streets, I worry that too many people have the same influences and take the same photos. I don't want to become too tainted.</li><li>Keep consuming media from people who have different styles from mine.</li><li>Plan more.</li><li>Keep cold DMing. Cold DM everyone in Stockholm asking for photo advice. Cold DM anyone who wants photos. I need to meet more people.</li></ul><p>I think reaching out is the best win I can get here. I do enough of the rest - I just need to meet people. Nothing's new.** 21:02Things to write about</p><ul><li>Consequences of camera settings and how they can add to photos</li><li>Meta software development (not the company, the practice)</li><li>Day in life</li><li>Sweden</li><li>Fiction** 22:16Learning from riot photos</li><li>Take burst shots. No single photos.</li><li>Bring the bigger camera. Nobody will care.</li><li>Tell stories with the frames - prioritizing getting the lines straight over focusing on perspectives is too much.</li><li>Take more photos than you think you'll need - just point and hold the shutter down.</li><li>Slow shutter speed is great for showing motion.</li><li>Really wide focal length can show you down. Ricoh was not the best tool here.</li><li>Keep your hand still if you're shooting at low shutter speeds..** 22:59I think I'm happier when I'm making my own work than I am when consuming the work of others. Finding references is good - but my life doesn't have the most balanced approach atm! I'm taking too much in and not putting enough out.</li></ul><p>How much time is healthy to dedicate to 'input'? Depends on the medium, I think - but I'm dialed in basically 16 hours a day. There's no way that my current attitude is healthy.</p><p>More often than not, when I see something on are.na that I like - I've already saved the thing to one of my channels and the person who saved it - why it showed up - follows me, meaning they likely found the thing from me to begin with. That has to be a sign to stop - or, at the least, slow pace.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/5a89651d65c250b4894e8fabf8df779be7c36717//2023-09-24.md">5a89651d</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/bd6ef411a77b559d128b5d593e73a414eef7d577//2023-09-24.md">bd6ef411</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/308bc47b0c86c7f6182d5ed485d562dfc0b91b4a//2023-09-24.md">308bc47b</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/9cbfa0c1389e7c5e1bea649675990b3f2ac8ca78//2023-09-24.md">9cbfa0c1</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/dc080fbaf2f95b0253a54af03bf28fc37c47ff02//2023-09-24.md">dc080fba</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/8e8def52d80b024f26891789a046a28e7a6d6d62//2023-09-24.md">8e8def52</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-24</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/2a7f31cd673af04f90037570c438622e82d5117c//2023-09-24.md">2a7f31cd</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-09-25.html">2023-09-25</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-09-23.html">2023-09-23</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
