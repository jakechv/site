It's hard to remember that decisions that are hard for you are the ones worth making - you'll have more work off your back afterwards. Better to admit something outright than to let it drag on and drain life.</p><p>We'll see how Stockholm works out. The company leaves me a lot of opportunity to push myself from a product development and  domain perspective. Climate change is important.</p><p>The phrasing I use to address subjects of conversation feels too negative. Offering my perspective is too easy of a way to enter a conversation. Ask more questions of others rather than stating an opinion or truth and debating merits of consequences. Question more, question deeper, and state less.** 02:38I'm far more inspired by information in context. Images on the internet re-assembled carry much less meaning than parts of complete works. This is why my work feels fragmented, incomplete, unfinished.** 11:15LinkedIn idea - use it for tracking gym progress. Each core exercise is a job. Update your title at that job whenever you go up in weight. Don't use an API or anything technical - that's a waste of time.** 22:24Emulator that pops up in a page just like a tiling window manager.</p><p>Pops up when you plug in a device.</p><p>Can connect one of those cool retro gaming controllers to your computer and it'll boot on the screen in a little window!</p><p>Shoutout tiling window managers and modular computing. I will make the dream real. One weekend at a time.** 23:03There is some aesthetic space to explore between NASA and Unix, Game boy and playdate and teenage engineering, low-fidelity programs and customizable, single-developer works of brilliance. Inspired by Mechner's work on Persia - holding the whole game in your head - and the beautiful animation on consoles like the Playdate and GBA, brilliantly fluid work through just a couple of pixels. I want to pick up controllers and route them through different programs, generating ambient music in the background with some daemon that visibly 'plugs into' other aspects of the screen. The tiling window manager feels connected, knolling your desktop for you just like you'd love a physical setup to be. There should be little delineation between the layout of physical objects and the desktop - MacOS doesn't deserve to feel so different from the analog synthesizer setup on the desktop. Pixel by pixel, knob by knob, grid by square perfection. Drawing in the terminal feels just like drawing in the GBA window - pixel by pixel or character by character. Something about how this all feels and flows together - I'm not sure how to explain or get to the root of the itch in my brain.</p><p>I love short and addictive games with high replayability. I love roguelikes and pokemon and these little playdate gimmicks and everything I was playing on the phone in middle school. I want to hold a controller proper in my hand and make some.** 23:37It's fine to build programs that are desktop-first, but:</p><ul><li>They should be trivially cross-platform.</li><li>You should be able to send anyone a web link for them to test out without any friction.</li></ul></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-20</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ad6910b41cb6f837680888bfe8592290d91fbfe2//journals/2023-03-20.md">ad6910b4</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-20</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/0872af68444b00f4498dc7aa5042204a7df757e8//journals/2023-03-20.md">0872af68</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-20</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/518ae5544e63f4e8907868ba459f9d38e8789f15//journals/2023-03-20.md">518ae554</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-20</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/cb637ce5960885785dbf5d83c3cd7ef90a9dbf72//journals/2023-03-20.md">cb637ce5</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-03-20</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/aadbcc0d97bd91fda4a847913c9a5cb81634420b//journals/2023-03-20.md">aadbcc0d</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></body></html>
