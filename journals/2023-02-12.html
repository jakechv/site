I was struck by the beauty of HarvardBusiness School's Chapel of the Class of 1959, of the koi pond and thewonderful couple warming up in the sun under the humid, pyramidal roofon what was otherwise a miserable twenty degree afternoon on Harvard'sNorth Allston campus. I saw the man leave soon after, walking towards aclassroom - he could have been a professor, or student, or neighborhoodresident, or anyone, with medditeranean olive skin and a wizened faceand wonderfully patient mannerisms - and I wish I'd talk to him, as ittook me a minute to realize that he was not judging me, but ratherappreciating that I was appreciating the space as well as I photographedthe pews of the chapel. The wrought-iron door had to be ten feet tallbut was opened and closed by him seamlessly. There was some beautifulknowledge and strength hidden in his frailty. Or he used a buttonsomewhere.\]</p><h2 id="2016-from-13023-1531-we-all-deserve-to-be-taken-on-walks">20:16 from 1/30/23, 15:31: "we all deserve to be taken on walks"</h2><p>A woman walked by me in Allston's Ringer Park, walking her small dog (orpuppy?) as she said this over the phone. She either nodded or revealed acurt smile - I can't recall which - in that dispassionate Boston act ofacknowledgement, one I still don't entirely understand, not even afterhaving lived in the place for four years. Anywhere else, the gesturewould be an acknowledgement of some kind of shared misery; the Bostonacknowledgement feels almost as if tension with strangers isn'tflirtatious, but painful and depressing. My roommate is a New Englandnative. He tells me that people are just in their own worlds, livingtheir own lives, doing their own thing. Other transplants from west toeast coast have told me through a sort of social meme that Boston peopleare kind, but not nice, and that California is nice but not kind. Ibelieve that San Francisco's cutthroat private high schools or LosAngeles' theater drama is that cutthroat, full of the backhandcompliments we all grew up watching on Disney channel or Flubber or MeanGirls that have been assimilated by our culture one way or another. Myown upbringing, though, was modest and quiet and shy and kind - trulykind - so I worry about others from the west who weren't truly loved andwhether the east coast mirrors that discomfort. Strangers to me todayare friends I have yet to meet, so to discomfort and distrust sopublicly scares me. My roommate is one of the kindest and most welcomingpeople to strangers I have ever met; this trait has made his life sobeautiful, now that he's surrounded by this cornocopia of skate kids andrejects and music culture and personality that seems to revolve aroundhim with trust and empathy. He's been around for me for five years.Thanks, Arman.</p><h2 id="2121-how-to-defeat-an-idea-1617-today">21:21 how to defeat an idea \[16:17 today\]</h2><ul><li>our brains have a lot of ideas</li><li>we have to try to kill as many as we can to get them out of our brains</li><li>the ones that survive we should have the conviction to realize</li></ul></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"><tr><td><a href="/journals/2023-02-12.html#sunday-02122023">sunday-02122023</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/journals/2023-02-12.html#2010-from-13123-1555-wordlesslu">2010-from-13123-1555-wordlesslu</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/journals/2023-02-12.html#2016-from-13023-1531-we-all-deserve-to-be-taken-on-walks">2016-from-13023-1531-we-all-deserve-to-be-taken-on-walks</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/journals/2023-02-12.html#2121-how-to-defeat-an-idea-1617-today">2121-how-to-defeat-an-idea-1617-today</a></td></tr></table></div><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2023-02-12.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-02-18.html">2023-02-18</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-02-09.html">2023-02-09</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></div></div></div></body></html>
