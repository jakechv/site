The code was quick and sloppy anyways.if so, we can preserve the same interface and refactor the interior. The user should notice performance improvements and consistencies and have a slightly better experience using the platform after this. These benefits are so marginal, though, that they're a bit masturbatory - unless code has to be reused and redesigned extensively, the complexity just isn't worth incurring.** 16:00</p><p>Did not think gym withdrawal would feel this bad. My arms ache. I can feel my shoulders shrinking. It's hard to ignore the discomfort. I've spent too much time on Instagram filling in the endorphins. Time to perfect body weight exercises until I find a gym subscription.</p><p>Finding it harder to work out of cafes than at home now. I'm so happy with my home environment that I feel comfortable and focused working there. There are no longer any roommates, bad heating, reparis that need to be made, creaky floors, etc. to distract me. Cafes are full of people - people to interact with, people to talk to and spend time with. Cafes are for writing and creative work. The home and the office are for deep, focused work.</p><p>Having a big room - without a clear desk - helps demonstrably. The laptop is the work surface, and the room can be rearranged to sit wherever is most comfortable to work. The bed is small and out of the way, making work inconvenient. Having the bed, the kitchen and hte bathroom out of sight while working helps reserve dedicated time for focused work. I'm really impressed by how well I can concentrate.</p><p>A studio apartment is for me then.** 17:17I want to be able to describe a feeling and have the user interface change in respond to the feeling; the bubbles get rounder the more relaxed we get, the colors more vibrant - or the font more stiff and formal, the corners sharper and the padding decreased. What a brilliant brand design tool - to describe what kind of interface you want and just make it!** 17:20The dream apartment is a huge studio with bright windows and a single room for living and working and sleeping. The kitchen and bathroom are small and out of the way. The room is configurable, the furniture can be moved, and anything creative can be made in the center. I want a beautiful workshop with the desk right in the middle.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-04-10</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/3beb4b25433533cf0c576d2a12dc25babdac22e5//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-10.md">3beb4b25</a></td></tr><tr><td>2023-04-10</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/186cd5bda724a88269313a5643bd2ebfbabd37ad//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-10.md">186cd5bd</a></td></tr><tr><td>2023-04-10</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/8918e262b70c124a0411ec25927327dc03e329e0//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-10.md">8918e262</a></td></tr><tr><td>2023-04-10</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/da4861caad29f3eea2905bada699c1a2898c1017//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-10.md">da4861ca</a></td></tr><tr><td>2023-04-10</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/3dda1efcab7d7e8b707e96b2d9bb90c2d9a2c628//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-10.md">3dda1efc</a></td></tr><tr><td>2023-04-10</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/250bc5f9acc5551597692137cb31643ee74750bf//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-04-10.md">250bc5f9</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
