In prose, the worst thing one can do with words issurrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you thinkwordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have beenvisualising you probably hunt about until you find the exact words thatseem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are moreinclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a consciouseffort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and dothe job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing yourmeaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long aspossible and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures andsensations. Afterward one can choose – not simply accept – the phrasesthat will best cover the meaning, and then switch round and decide whatimpressions one's words are likely to make on another person.</p><p>George Orwell: Politics and the English Language</p><p>In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which inhibitsyoung professionals, new students most severely, is their acceptance ofstandards that are too low. If I ask a student whether her design is asgood as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me as if to say, "Ofcourse not, that isn't what I am trying to do…. I could never do that."</p><p>Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must beour standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard isworthwhile. That is what I expect of myself in my own buildings, and itis what I expect of my students." Gradually, I show the students thatthey have a right to ask this of themselves, and must ask this ofthemselves. Once that level of standard is in their minds, they will beable to figure out, for themselves, how to do better, how to makesomething that is as profound as that.</p><p>Christopher Alexander: foreword to Richard Gabriel's "Patterns OfSoftware"</p><p>noam chomsky: manufacturing consent.</p><p>\[The\] point is not that innovation attracts groups but that innovationis found in groups: that it tends to arise out of social interaction –conversation, validation, the intimacy of proximity, and the look inyour listener's eye that tells you you're onto something. …</p><p>When \[Erasmus Darwin, James Watt, Joseph Priestley, etc.\] were notmeeting, they were writing to each other with words of encouragement oradvice or excitement. This was truly – in a phrase that is invariablyand unthinkingly used in the pejorative – a mutual-admiration society. …</p><p>What were they doing? Darwin, in a lovely phrase, called it"philosophical laughing," which was his way of saying that those whodepart from cultural or intellectual consensus need people to walkbeside them and laugh with them to give them confidence. …</p><p>We divide \[groups\] into cults and clubs, and dismiss the former fortheir insularity and the latter for their banality. The cult is theplace where, cut off from your peers, you become crazy. The club is theplace where, surrounded by your peers, you become boring. Yet if you cancombine the best of those two – the right kind of insularity with theright kind of homogeneity – you create an environment both safe enoughand stimulating enough to make great thoughts possible.</p><p>Malcolm Gladwell: Group Think</p><p>the royal family gives people something to pay attention to and gossipabout while the politicians can get the real work done behind the scenes</p><p>come back to these quotes;
