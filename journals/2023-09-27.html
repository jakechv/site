I barely even know what I want from a UI framework.</p><ul><li>First: I have to continue building my personal website and add more primitives, more abstractions, logic for transitions. Get comfortable with my own workflow.</li><li>Build a couple of applications with Next.js or other 'state of the art tools'. Not splash pages or toys. Professional-looking applications.</li><li>Try building a mobile app or some sort of mobile interface for one of those abstractions.</li><li>Learn from using those multiple paradigms. Try to figure out what could be better. Try out those Rust Web UI experiments and whatever Swift is doing.</li></ul><p>Only after doing these things will I be prepared to revisit all of that graphics rendering stuff!!!!!!!!!** 16:20I love Figma. Blown away by how responsive it is every time I use it. Can't wait for the experience to get closer to code.</p><p>Feels like user interface style systems should be redesigned 'figma-first'. Flexbox - and similar responsive systems - are great, sure, but we can add those retroactively. 'Convert to responsive component' or something atop of the mockup. So much of this mockup - any mockup - could be trivially converted to code if we had the right system, but this is only possible if the UI framework is tightly coupled to the design tool.</p><p>I want this to be real.** 20:37The Apple keyboard feels so shallow compared to my other devices; the huge amount of resistance that the X-T3 puts in front of my fingers makes these keys so touchy by comparison, with so little travel... being human is about getting used to our tools so quickly. Joel was shocked that I had a Swedish keyboard - but for me to adjust to it took no time at all.</p><p>Let's talk about camera gear.</p><p>I can tell that the Fuji's sensor is better - or that, at least, it injects some magic into the colors of each photo - and that's helped shape my style and take good photos.</p><p>However: those buttons are painful to press. It's genuinely difficult to change exposure compensation without reassigning a dial, and settings can't be quickly flicked into place; it's either one click at a time or a rough, forced transition for a very different setting. This is not the camera for fast photos.</p><p>I know the Ricoh wins, but let's break it down - I want a camera that:</p><ul><li>Can be shot one-handed</li><li>Has IBIS to catch movement and enable one handed shots</li><li>Fits in my pocket or is otherwise unobtrusive when bringing it around</li><li>Has a versatile focal length</li><li>USB-C charging</li><li>Fast lens</li><li>Quick changing settings</li></ul><p>Today it became so obvious how obtrusive the Fuji is - I have to keep it on the end of its 'leash' - camera strap - to guarantee that the image is stable, given no IBIS; the camera's a bit heavy to hold one-handed - tires my arm just enough to want a second hand sometimes - but that isn't much of a problem. Everyone around me reacted to me holding a camera; looked my way, gave me a weird look, tried to hide a bit, posed a little bit... maybe it's just imagined but the Fuji provoked a different reaction. This bus driver stared at me for ten minutes as I took photos around Slussen - and she wasn't even in the photos! I kept having to change settings and miss shots, too... bring the hand up to the camera or the camera down to the hand, make adjustment, repeat. Not a fun process.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-28</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/f57618e3a93267b482a494f0fc43356c0849b795//2023-09-27.md">f57618e3</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-27</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/a732146de375154048c33814f37fa3d81f6f853b//2023-09-27.md">a732146d</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-09-27</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/7bbf46460da52b25a4271e65c94ff3834a147f70//2023-09-27.md">7bbf4646</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-09-28.html">2023-09-28</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-09-26.html">2023-09-26</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
