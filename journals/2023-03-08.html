Dreaming of a future tiny apartment that I own, that I can decorate with 70s plastic furniture to feel part Mondrian, part Lego, all plastic toy. I want space where Legos spilled out on the floor look like an art installation, not a mess; where my children have space to run around and play; where people can feel comfortable and cozy but not without fun. My house should feel like a modernist childhood. All of the furniture looks comfortable pretty much anywhere in the house and can be rearranged on the fly. Music is always playing and there are always decks to scrub music around or a piano to let go with. Art is never permanent; it's manifested in furniture or projected on walls or visible on computer screens throughout the house.</p><p>How can I make my wardrobe feel more playful? I've been into beautiful things, things that last forever, pop things lately - but above all it's important that my clothes are simple, comfortable, and I can do anything in them. Love the bright blues and baggy playful texture. Hate looking cool or unapproachable. Silver goes a long way towards feeling cool and fun, but cool is a trap. Cool is Supreme, cool is trend, cool is uniqueness for the sake of it, not for any real interest in the subject. Cool is eschewing REI clothing for name brands, getting complex instead of simple, looking old instead of new, having more and doing more instead of owning less and knowing less, where knowing less is a beautiful luxury in the age of the information diet. Know less, do more, and have fun.</p><p>Still posting a photo every day. Eventually I'll learn to tell stories. The best strategy for me now is to keep posting, posting, posting, putting my work out there to get noticed. The best thing I can do for myself is probably to start shooting TikToks - but I can do that later.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-03-08</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/cc707ee152849f125532b56816ace92bce39c08b//home/jake/wiki/journals/2023-03-08.md">cc707ee1</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
