We can mock an OS and dodgerequiring the development of kernel code, drivers, etc. by running JOSSoff of a shell on Linux, but this doesn't feel <u>real</u> in the way anoperating system might. (Though it might be a good idea to avoidattempting to run on bare metal, if for no other reason than to preservesanity…). Whatever the case, this is an excuse to work on real OSdevelopment in the future - we'll see how my system evolves down theline.</p><h2 id="permacomputing">permacomputing</h2><p>various resources about computing long term<a href="id:d760c493-0377-495c-b259-f8e62a4b3561">permacomputing</a></p><ul><li><a href="https://computingwithinlimits.org/2021/">LIMITS 2021 – Workshop on Computing withinLimits</a> Very coolorganization and workshop system about computing with limits - usingvery small amounts of resource consumption, particularly with respectto software, in order to minimize our impact on the environment - andto preserve our sense of mental sanity. Most work, software orotherwise, is built upon pervasive, systemic that is opaquely andinnefectively abstracted away from the user by end user systems -every little slip of a memory leak, an unabstracted design decision ina codebase, every crack in an iphone, etc. is a consequence of thiscomplexity - but rolling back and redesigning systems to respect corecomputing can <u>empower</u> and <u>enhance</u> end users of thesoftware we do.</li><li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/permacomputing.html">XXIIVV —permacomputing</a>Advocates for <u>maintenance</u> - encouraging programmers to refactorand rewrite programs to ensure that they're small and efficient. Reuseand repair of existing technology should be encouraged - preserve timeand physical resources! Produces should be "designed fordisassembly" - ensuring that they can be disassembled for repair andend of life so that even when the component is no longer useful, itcan be reworked into other, relevant components. Lots of greatresources throughout this article - become familiar with them.</li><li>"Collapse informatics" - taking advantage of today's computing toprepare for future infrastructure breaking down. Systems shouldanticipate intermittent energy supply, network connectivity and small,non-global community; making core assumptions about global,internet-fueled network and communication is postulated by thisarticle to be completely unrealistic.</li><li><p><a href="http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html">Permacomputing \|viznut</a> Computers arefailing their expectations at every turn - taking advantage of peoplerather than empowering them, and proliferating material usage ratherthan allowing others to scale down their dependence on energy and theenvironment. Machines are supposed to be "optimizing" things for us -they should be using energy wisely! - but they do quite the opposite,abusing resources and performance as "calculation factories" to occupylots of space and resources. It's a miracle that chip innovation seemsto be beating software bloat on most counts - somehow our systems dorun faster despire all of the shit we keep piling onto them. We shouldoptimize our systems for resource efficiency and local communitynetworks! Programmers also often don't value any total understandingor control of the target system - utilizing whatever pile ofhigh-level abstractions that their computer's dependent on rather thanunderstanding how to integrate with systems and metal. It's importantto, at times, work on the "computer's level" rather than the level ofabstraction established for you to use! It's typically important tomake as many programs as dumb as possible - if programs are tools,they should be understandable, predictable, and not get out of yourway or handle any "magic". (This is the article's position; to me,programming systems that inspire a sense of wonder - i.e. the typethat make end users wonder how certain systems are even possible - areprobably the best and most interesting thing about computing). Thearticle postulates that smart programs often complicate core missionsand waste lots of computational resources to accomplish what it seemsto frame as minimal gain - or, at least, something to be skeptical of.</p><p>Postulates that communities that use technology should developrelationships with it - technology should be flexible, not live at the"app" abstraction layer! I believe in this too - it's vital for thosewho <u>use</u> technology to <u>understand</u> it. Users should put asmuch effort into understanding their technology as they do while usingit; the 'app' and choices of modern operating systems have largelykilled this mindset, but it's <u>so</u> important to bring hacking -true hacking - and true introspection back into the computer systemswe use. We need to drop the proprietary OS - not through Android orsome corporate watered-down sponsorship, but <u>seriously</u>'reworking the system'! Software should be introspectable andsocieties should support its development.</p></li></ul><h1 id="an-aside-what-makes-a-relationship-work">an aside: what makes a relationship work?</h1><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eight-Dates-relationship-thriving-lasting/dp/0241988357/">Eight Dates: To keep your relationship happy, thriving and lasting:Gottman,…</a></p><h1 id="analysis-of-different-programming-systems---how-do-we-categorize-them">Analysis of different programming systems - how do we categorize them?</h1><p><a href="id:9d566115-cfc1-4fec-833e-636e69a4e4fe">Programming Languages</a> <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/staged.html">StagedProgramming</a></p><h1 id="ive-been-reading-too-much">I've been reading too much</h1><p>Spend more time working on the system than you do reading for/about it!I have more than enough "abstract" knowledge already, and what I don'thave I have to collect via practical experience. In fact - whateversystem I design should <u>encourage</u> design by experimentation, bytrial and error, by composability - and a REPL based system is perfectfor this; integrated into menus, as a data analysis tool, as an end-userinterface, etc. I want inline repls everywhere to play with ideas, toget feedback, to query for more data - it's impossible for a UI to show<u>everything</u>, so it's the role of the system itself to allow theuser to ask for what they want to see rather than trying to give themall of the information right away! The end user just needs the tools todo so. End user software should be configurable, interactive, andpersonalized - we should be able to ask questions of it and receivevaluable answers, to analyze its insides and delve as deep as we desire,to transparently explore the <u>depths</u> of a system. Open source isso valuable for this, but it's not flexible and only touches smallsegments of computing - we might be able to do better.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/journals/2021-12-15.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
