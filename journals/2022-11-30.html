I'm not sure. Dedicating myself toone thing and perfecting it - becoming an expert in something - soundsbeautiful. Assuming the goals of the company continue to be beneficialto society at large (whatever this means), my work will be valuable.</p><p>Focusing on creative work on the side still makes a lot of sense. I'llhave to be super deliberate about separating my personal work with workfor the company; the two will have to scratch very different places inmy brain, and I won't know what parts of my life will scratch whichitches until I start doing them. I like my social life to feel and becool - it helps with design, it helps with day jobs, and music isbeautiful. Working with creative people is out there and fulfilling in away that technical work cannot be. We'll see if I can tap into theStockholm scene; I'll give myself six months to do so.</p><p>All this said, I want to tie up a lot of loose ends with my work beforeI go: I want to make that new window manager, improve my text editor,and set the foundations for the technical and social work I want to dogoing forward. I'll need a usable site to write on - and to developfast, interactive visualizations with, to properly explain my ideas. Ineed to develop tools and establish foundations for the work I want todo going forward. Can't start any new things while juggling full-timework, social life and creative work; no loose ends.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2022-11-30.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
