Very quickly realizedthat he has a much stronger understanding of what <strong>matters</strong> than I do;each word is concise and deliberate, whereas I felt like I was graspingfor ideas that I was excited by but didn't fully understand. Tons ofcontrol over time. Reminds me of people like Ben. This excited bouncingaround between different disciplines and getting an ear of new ideasisn't cutting it anymore - people I like the work of are becoming mypeers, and they've done far more work - not reading essays or scrollingtwitter or whatever - than I have.</p><p>Acting class: unimportant. I made a couple of comments about the playthat weren't <strong>exactly</strong> true and felt bad for not knowing better whenreviewing the work during the course. I should have been more focusedwhen reading. Had to bail on project meeting with Pete due to missedprioritizations over the course of the last few days. Work with Ryan wasnot the most focused, but we made clear progress; our disorganized DPcode reflects this.</p><p>Spent the evening working through this wiki for a few hours; clickinglinks, writing down and saving what really matters. That's all.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2022-11-02.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
