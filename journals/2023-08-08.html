I was playing a weighted interval scheduling problem - collecting all of these different ideas, determining what might fit in the schedule and what might not, evaluating budgetary constraints - but I hadn't pinned anything down.</p><ol><li>Establish constraints. What's the vacation budget? Are there any must-see events? When are those happening? How much time do I have off of work? Solidify any plans with friends; you have to be in X place at time Y.</li><li>Use hard constraints to make a first decision. Book the first thing chronologically - train trip, hostel, flight, etc. Months in advance if possible.</li><li>Dedicate time every day to booking a couple more things. Taking a break to think about the decision is healthy - take one step at a time. Time spent per place doesn't really matter as long as it fits in your constraints - you can find things to do almost anywhere in the world at any time, really. You can spend those extra days however you'd like. Being rushed is cool too - you can see a city in a couple hours with the right mode of transportation - and can always go back!</li></ol><p>Don't stress. Impossible to plan fun things when planning the thing isn't a fun experience - you can't imagine yourself interested when you're stressed about it. Plan a couple of things a day and chill. Don't disrupt your daily routine for it.** 18:03Things I need to think about when taking photos:</p><ul><li>Space. For a photo to 'tell a clear message, have a clear story', whatever - for that photo to fit my style, whatever that style is - the photo needs lots of negative space. Subjects need room to breathe.</li><li>Honest expression. I don't want to catch people off-guard, but it's important that people are not posing, or poised, or acted. To take a good photo of someone, I have to talk to them for at least an hour - enough for them to become comfortable with their environment. That's the only way to see someone honestly.</li><li>What's the third one?</li></ul></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-08-08</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/7bda4523121690a1a12a6494f173b8f5a67955c9//2023-08-08.md">7bda4523</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-08-08</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/d8111ea913b1e51c22ff78fa17360426982a12a3//2023-08-08.md">d8111ea9</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-08-09.html">2023-08-09</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-08-06.html">2023-08-06</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
