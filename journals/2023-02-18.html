First week of work is going well. I lovethat I work with good software developers, and that I don't have toworry about feature ideas yet. At previous jobs I tried to be toocreative, obsessing over the work and pushing feature after feature thatI wanted. My features had less relevance to the product's success than Iwould have liked. Most of them were related to tech debt, which doesn'tmatter as long as the product works. It's nice to let other peoplehandle the prioritization while you handle the coding. Someone tells youto focus on a feature or gives you a scope, you take over and fixeverything in that scope, and you're done. No reinventing the world.Strict requirements and questions to push and prod with, but most of thetime this is the responsibility of the product people.</p><p>The business idea is so easy and straightforward. It's going to be awinner because this team will make it a winner. I will make this companywin. Leslie was so happy when she told me that she was just grateful tohave a job, her ideal job, the job she loved. I will code and code andcommunicate and communicate until we do so much that we can win. We canbe the dominant force in the market by EOY 2024. Incredibly grateful tohave such clear goalposts and to be given the opportunity to somethingthat matters so much. Emissions reporting is unsexy but it will run theworld.</p><p>Photo work is going well. Ordering prints for people is a good problemto have. I will keep posting day after day after day. Worried aboutstagnating, but I have plenty of ideas - low shutter speed, get in thestudio, do some more fashion work.</p><p>Also worried about getting rid of clothes. Realizing that the texture ofan item and how it fits matter so much. My daily life feels negativelyor positively impacted by how mobile I am, how comfortable my clothesare, and how they make me look. I don't know how to hone a uniform, butI'll keep trying to sell things until I have to consolidate. For nowI'll stay comfortable.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-02-22</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//journals/2023-02-18.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
