maintenance is teaching, communicating(<u>not</u> preserving) tradition, and ensuring everything works andmoves smoothly. when everything "just works", it's been perfectly andwonderfully maintained.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease</a> cost disease:rise in salaries of jobs producing little to no increase of laborproductivity. it's insane!</p><p>teaching is about learning - not making students and lesson plans, butencouraging relationships with students that will occur time and timeagain.</p><p>i used to think 'maintainer' label on open source software was ugly -now i think it's probably the most noble goal of all.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/journals/2021-10-23.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
