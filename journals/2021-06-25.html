getting older means getting stingier withtime - with whom and why - and extroversion is great but it's hard tospend lots of time with lots of others without accomodation? weird note.this definitely reads as someone yound and a bit pretentious, thoughwith better taste in essay collections and writing than i. feels morelike reading is searching for something in this essay - readingexplicitly for self improvement or an escape rather than for readingitself. writing is hard!! like the explicit expression of her struggles.already synthesizing sources here, but the quotes feel scattered - notpurposefUl.</p><p>new places to clear the head? try all of it! stay everywhere, get lost,hard to really talk about things you don't have the words for.</p><p>i like how perceptive i've become when reading essays like this - itmeans that i'm well read and understand myself well enough to bothunderstand the lines and read through them. detecting immaturity is veryimportant - with no meaning of immaturity other than the maturity ofthoughts - as these observations inform just how much i've grown andlearned about myself, even though i haven't been able to makesubstantial material progress. the ability to honestly criticizeyourself may be the most valuable skill to have - as criticism meansimprovement, and being able to generate that criticism allows you tocontinue to generate improvement without a lot of external distraction.this could also be a sign of immaturity, though - as having lots of selfcriticism (honest, not deprecative) means that you haven't yet takensuch criticisms to heart, so having no more criticism for yourself is asign either that you can control yourself too little or that you focuson yourself too much. i have a headache. goodbye. ava used the liminalspaces cliche in this writing - and though i can relate to this thirstfor experience no matter what the experience is, it seems silly todesire living on the brink of something rather than fully eperiencingit. we'll never find what we're looking for in each other!</p><p>just opened linkedin and saw a profile i'd seen before but who i have noreal connection to. maybe it is time to quit socials</p><h2 id="1909-last-writing-from-ava-we-never-learn-again">19:09 last writing from ava: we never learn (again)</h2><p>protect good habits quit before the bad habit digs in hard work doesn'tfeel good at the time but it feels great later stick with those who areemotionally healthy fear of rejection is very expensive always assertboundaries</p><p>we are both worthy of unconditional love - we didn't ask to be born sowe should be cared for - but also full of flaws and dynamics that provedifficult to navigate. we build lives and burn them down, continuing toabandon the things we enjoy. nothing more potent than playing games youcan't afford with people you don't deserve. that's the best line in thisessay - an incredible one. we never learn</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/journals/2021-06-25.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
