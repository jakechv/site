Most beautiful thing I've seenin a long time. There is something perfect about a well-honed flowstate - being able to watch someone execute on something live thatthey've planned out and thought about well ahead of time - and all ofthe members of this orchestra excelled at that. I'm completely enamored.Watching the last artist - Jessie Sun - was something else. In completeconcentration and in complete control the whole time, he masterfullyexecuted this cacaphony of music that began with Korean female-lead popvocal chops, but quickly merged into an elaborate blend of medium-tempoharmonic music reminiscent of Porter Robinson's work - but far moreelaborate. The immaculate visuals of blended faces created real motionbetween the projectors - an incredible use of the space - right to left,left to right, then in and out of a seam in the screen itself, changingdirection and tempo under the control of a video-directing Ableton Liveinstance - while the music itself was all composed in a Tidal buffer!</p><p>I've never seen someone in such a flow state before - especially notwhen executing on a live performance. His movements were small, focusedand precise - but you could see exactly what was going on in Jessie'shead as the music and visuals transformed in the translucent VSCodebuffer projected through the elaborate motion.</p><p>I want computing and coding to feel like that. I think it's possible,and I think it starts with the user interface and window manager. Ithink we can make computing beautiful again.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/journals/2022-12-13.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
