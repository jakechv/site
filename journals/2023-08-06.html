The Whole Earth Catalog is subtitled 'access to tools'. That's somehow relevant.</li></ul><p>I thought this point was profound somehow but now it's obviously not true. Learning popular tools is not important. What's cool is the ability to use any tool from Earth's documented history on this laptop or through a computer in some way. Learn to express yourself in any way you can. Just make sure to master one.</p><p>I think I was thinking about using tools that everyone has to use and making them perfect - something along those lines. I've written about this at length here before, I think; hone the way you express yourself with mediums that you have to use anyways. The instant message, for example, or the email, or the documentary photo, or the calendar appointment, or good food, or working out, or the clothing you wear. Everyone has to wear clothes and make food and send emails and text messages. Make sure you do it your way. Developing a unique style to use everywhere in that way is beautiful.** 20:41Finishing thoughts on clothing from yesterday. I want to be:</p><ul><li>Approachable. What I'm wearing should broadcast in some way that I'm relaxed and comfortable with sitting down and taking the time to talk to anyone I meet.</li><li>Flexible. Clothing should be versatile enough to wear in the office, to the park, on a run or at the gym. I should never have to change clothes to hop on a bike or jump a fence or make a meeting (very important, planned meetings aside).</li><li>Durable. Clothing should last. I shouldn't have to refresh clothes or watch them fall apart every couple of years. I shouldn't have to spend lots of time caring for the things I wear every day. (I hate that I have to spend so much time caring about this apartment...)</li></ul><p>This means:</p><ul><li>Natural fabrics (for the most part.) Loose wools, cottons, and linens are wonderful. They look warm and comforting while operating well.</li><li>Light colors or black for the most part. Black is functional - absorbent, hides stains, easy to care for. Pastels are relaxed and welcoming.</li><li>Water resistant and flexible fabric. Fabric has to stretch or, at the least, have a great cut cut to allow for good range of motion. Don't wear anything that limits how you move.</li></ul></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-08-06</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/2b62053b7757b8c10c69f045d9cf4699e24678f1//2023-08-06.md">2b62053b</a></td></tr><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-08-06</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/68d91a7cb8a2989a95445fbc678367f600a4e1e5//2023-08-06.md">68d91a7c</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-08-08.html">2023-08-08</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-08-05.html">2023-08-05</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
