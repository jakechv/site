regardless, i'll keep up myposting regimen to ensure that i'm holding myself accountable in termsof my creative goals - three posts a week no matter what.</p><p>there are too many places to go and too many things to do but i know ineed to just focus on one or a few. i'm a good software engineer and ishould continue to hone that skill. what else?</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/journals/2021-06-24.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
