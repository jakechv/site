somehow sensing hostility from the crowd? marvin says hisapproach to sexuality is subtle exhibitionism - can't deal with the rawfact, so it's vealed in some expression of the idea rather than the actsthemselves. often it takes just minutes for him to write songs!!! butcontrived music takes much longer. self admitting this in and of itselfis impressive.</p><p>interviewing seems like an excellent life skill, as interesting asgetting to know people is and more. asking good questions is one of thebest skills you can have. i really need to practice interviewing andtalking to others!!!!</p><p>rarely deal in the past - all that's important is whether you get thenext laugh or not! the reflections of the artist on seeing gaye livewithout talking to him later are very flat expressions of ideas - notincredibly interesting. i didn't enjoy this article overall - it readsas if the author is trying to push their ego into the piece, but theyhesitate before corrupting the article as a 'journalistic' piece. thereisn't a clear thesis or piece of information the author is trying toimpart, and yet the writing strings together cherry-picked bits ofinformation from gaye and from the author's personal life, seeminglywithout purpose. i don't doubt the interviewing skill of the author, buttheir ability to properly frame their thoughts - even in this synopsis -to present a clear message is sorely lacking.</p><h3 id="helena---forever---2016">helena - forever - 2016</h3><p><a href="https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/forever">https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/forever</a> having the idea to write andchoosing to write on substack rather than on my own terms may have beena poor decision. substack is a great system for content delivery, butdoesn't provide any value aside from that.</p><p>love citations of other authors in this piece. george carlin - owning apet is investing in a small tragedy. life is just investing in largerones, surely? it's unclear to what degree we choose our path and to whatdegree we simply end up with who and what is left. someone being oldersimply means that you will, on average, be able to spend less timetogether, no different than any other serious medical condition. i oftenthink about how old twenty one is and that it feels much too old -rappers, singers, tik tok artists, what have you are blowing up atsixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, and it's hard not to be leftbehind - but at the same time i know i had issues that prevented me frompursuing those kinds of things when i was in high school, even thoughi'm free now. addiction to consumption may be the biggest issue that iface now. there is still far too much i want to learn about and explore,but i'm not sure if that's a figment of some sort of informationaddiction or some honest curiosity for working everywhere and doingeverything. the nails on my left hand are getting long enough thatthey're starting to be annoying, but i'm proud of that because i'venever had that before. we're working on the right hand, and the feet,and we will get there someday.</p><p>love is a preemptive form of grief - allowing something to matter isanother way of saying that you will care when it's gone, and thingsdisappearing is inevitable. this commitment scares me. it's hitting methat if i don't do lots of work now then i might struggle in the future,so work is not so much a convenience or somethign for entertainment asit is a necessity, and i have not been doing so hot in that department.the thought of staging a death is fascinating - completely preparing ascene for the inevitable.</p><p>wolfgang weingart - brilliant graphic designer - pre current trend ofmaximalism, very orward, accomplished a lot memphis group - postmodernfurniture, lighting fabrics, carpets, ceramics, glass, metal objects.foundational contributors to current trends, though much less homogenous</p><p>read wilhelm meister's apprenticeship</p><h2 id="1814-others">18:14 others</h2><p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/advice.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/advice.html</a>: great list of resources forapplying to grad school. check back on this if i really decide to pursueit!! <a href="https://elliott.computer/">https://elliott.computer/</a> <a href="https://saffronhuang.com/">https://saffronhuang.com/</a> both coolwebsites i am cutting off because i don't want to spend the time toexplore - not right now. enjoyed saffron's 'managers instead of elites'piece as well as the ideas behind the handmade web.</p><h3 id="great-recommendations">great recommendations</h3><h2 id="1930-more-articles-this-time-in-the-evening">19:30 more articles, this time in the evening.</h2><h3 id="upside-decay">upside decay</h3><p><a href="https://brianlui.dog/2020/10/06/upside-decay/">https://brianlui.dog/2020/10/06/upside-decay/</a> upside provides apositive outcome in a normal distribution of luck outcomes - presentingadditional benefit that isn't expected, such as scientific innovationthat improves society with little downside, and accomplishes things thatobjectively improve metrics that operate on a large scale - such asgdp - to demonstrate improved societal progress as a whole.</p><p>scientific innovation often results in progress happening in bursts -single large innovations are associated with demonstrable improvement,and with enough moonshots some are guaranteed to strike innovative gold,substantially raising certain metrics! if lots of things have to goright for a single successful discovery, this is effectively flippinglots of coins in succession - all heads and we have a winner! enoughshots and everything lines up just right.</p><p>upside decay is the decay in likelihood that these innovative eventsoccur - like running into someone in a coffee shop, or too atomscolliding, or something - and demonstrably harms changes of success. ifa coin flip lands on heads less than half the time, obviously you'remany times less likely to succeed in a task that combines multipleheads.</p><p>this has really corrosive effects on organizations and is often veryhard to spot - how do you quantify or measure upside decay in the momentrather than in retrospect? the article uses china as an example of anorganization that seeks stability and security in the global sphere.</p><p>author posits that upside decay is preceded by a lack of virtue - actingdisingenuously and without credibility, and rewarding behaviors otherthan those that will eventually be honest and optimal. author points tolots of chinese state decisions that reach this conclusion, decisionsthat may have been made with irrational means.</p><p>theory of 'weak ties' - informal networks, acquaintances, culturalinfluence, etc; weak ties only support virtuous decisions rather thanall decisions because they're not mandatory - they're volunteered,optional support. facebook falls into this trap - healthy teams quitonce hired because they don't support practice of optimiizing forrevenue above all else; culture and values are incredibly important,even if they don't align with optimal business decisions. berkshireseems to have trust, just as costco does - minimizing profit margins andoften not necessarily making the most optimal decision in exchange forextremely valuable opt-in relationships. (recent put all eggs in onebasket and watch the basket very carefully theory really comes to mindhere - spreading out means you're bound to lose track of something, andas such you're only going to end up average). positive sum interactiionsencourage people to do things because they want to - and these virtuousactions result in lots of lucky breaks, because others afford optionaloppoertunities to organizations that they're skeptical to entertainotherwise</p><h2 id="2034-ap-and-nazis-and-more">20:34 ap and nazis and more!</h2><p><a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/ap-collaboration-nazis-reporting-news">https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/ap-collaboration-nazis-reporting-news</a>as they compromized to obey nazi rule in return for being able tooperate, they ended up actively fueling nazi propaganda! they acceptedwhat was happening in germany and kept quiet, even though organizationslike the new york times did not - and yet, though the ap collaborated ona propagand aproject with the ss, they also helped jewish people safelysettle in other countries - what is moral here? they rehired some wholeft the AP to join the SS? is that right? news organizations from theUS operating in iran and saudi arabia make significant compromises towork in those territories - but never disclose what those cooperationsare. this is likely similar to israel palestine media coverage - israeland usgov have the power. or was AP collaborating with Hamas?</p><p>the articles's thesis: questioning the desire to report 'from inside',instead suggesting that we should look from the outside in to gainintelligence and report, because this is more moral than any sort ofinternal action. established sources publish unrelia ble information sofrequently for these exact reasons! kind of unrelated but i really likehow clean the website is - no distractions, just words.</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/journals/2021-06-22.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
