Practices go out of style, code ages anddeprecates. Companies rise, switch priorities and give up. Maintainershave families and run out of time. We can't count on the products we useor make to last forever, or even more than a couple of months longer.</p><p>The principal issue with this approach is the data silo. Proprietarycode running a software-as-a-service product often allows users toinput, format and manipulate their data – take services like are.na,Roam Research, or notion.so for example. These tools serve asrepositories for our data. Even services like Spotify and Facebook,though initially not meant for this purpose, become siloes for ourmemories – they store our posts, text messages, and interactions withone another over a long period of time, free to revisit at any moment.</p><p>When these products go under, this data disappears. There's no way toback it up, extract it or reuse it. The last employee to leave flips theswitch and shuts down all of the servers on the way out… goodbye data,regardless of how much time you've invested in the platform. Thishappened to me on Google Keep, on various startup notetaking servicesand social media products that fluttered out of existence as quickly asthey began, taking some priceless data with them. It's just like losingmy notebook the first semester of college: all of my journal entries,accurate knowledge of my emotions at the time, gone into the wind.</p><h2 id="i-feel-so-small">i feel so small</h2><p>why? i'm 21. i'm skilled. i have merit i think. what's holding me back?</p><h3 id="etc">etc</h3><p>the deindustrialization of america has hurt the middle class everythingis broken but how to we fix this life is all about temptation - buyingand selling ideas! ava: inconspicuous consumption. what makesyouacceptable is the accrual of a thousand different pieces of knowledge</p><h3 id="elliott-erwit-photographer">elliott erwit: photographer</h3><p>take photography seriously and treat it as a hobby i want pictures thatare emotional through china with a camera: john thomson</p><h2 id="2348-distribute-fact-checking">23:48 distribute fact checking</h2><p><a href="https://abe-winter.github.io/only/fans/2020/11/29/everything-in-moderation.html">https://abe-winter.github.io/only/fans/2020/11/29/everything-in-moderation.html</a>this is exactly my idea lmao @ url but</p></div></article></main><div class="git-hist-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>2023-02-22</td><td><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/ea5044fc387f17e24dcab6f3873a541cd640bfa1//home/jake/wiki/journals/2020-12-03.md">ea5044fc</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></body></html>
