Her outfit was great. I'm not quite sure why I didn't ask.</li><li>The American-German couple at the taco place. I should have asked them how their burritos were straightaway, even though I knew that I was going to buy one anyways. (By the way, that burrito was wonderful - a great mix of kebab, scandinavian-style pickled onion, and mexican meat. I would not call the place tex-mex, but )</li><li>The guy asked me about my watch at that restaurant - the person working behind the desk - both wonderful and tried to strike up a conversation. Should have kept talking to the Californian and her friend after asking for directions too - they kept asking about me and wanted to have a conversation! I could have had a wonderful night.</li><li>(Aside: I'm surprised how much German I can barely understand from the Swedish I can barely understand. A lot of the vocabulary I'm missing from English is quite similar.)</li><li>Love how pleasant joking around with people who pulled up on the street was; one guy (in his 60s, thereabouts) had a bike bell mounted onto his motorcycle and rang it as I nodded my head. We made eye contact and laughed together.</li><li>Two guys pulled up in a car in the turn lane in front of the burrito place. I nodded hello, then went to take a drink from my Fritz Apple; the can was empty. I looked and he laughed. I pulled out the vatten - (water - oops - but no backspaces today) - and they joked about it being vodka. Unfortunately not. Maybe next time!</li></ul><p>Reach out to everyone. You need to be socialmaxxing, to get to know everyone, to making connections around the world, to finding out why she would live in Hamburg.</p><p>What have I learned? That I need to be well-rested and feel good to feel prepared for that kind of thing. I need to have a decent outfit on, feel comfortable, etc... I've also learned that some people haven't paid for the Hamburg train in five years.</p><p>I also need to use as much of my free time as possible when I'm not around people to learn and build. Learn more languages - just the start, so I can build on those things in real life. Make a better  website. Take more photos. Wear better clothes.Wear better clothes.  Keep going!!!  Maximize what you can do in whatever position you're in. In Stockholm I should be aggressively making.</p><p>I like staying in places for long periods of time. One week feels good; it seems to fit well, but two weeks might be better. You want to be able to meet people one day and have enough time to see them again - one on one - to do something you both enjoy together before leaving the destination, and not just on some euro trip stuff. Meet a local.</p></div></article></main><div class="article-rhs-container"><div class="article-rhs"><span><div class="sitemap-container"><span class="sitemap-title">In this article</span><table class="sitemap"></table></div></span><span><div class="git-history-table-container"><span class="git-history-table-title">Revisions</span><table class="git-history-table"><tr><th>Date</th><th>Hash</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="commit-date-tr">2023-08-17</td><td class="commit-link-tr"><a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki/blob/58ed818f581bcdbcbf0f492ca143a85096d99b1a//2023-08-16.md">58ed818f</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></span><span><div class="prev-next-up-buttons-container">Navigation<table class="prev-next-up-buttons"><tr><td>Previous</td><td><a class="prev-button" href="/journals/2023-08-20.html">2023-08-20</a></td></tr><tr><td>Next</td><td><a class="next-button" href="/journals/2023-08-14.html">2023-08-14</a></td></tr><tr><td>Up</td><td><a class="up-button" href="/journals">journals</a></td></tr></table></div></span></div></div></div></body></html>
